Brian,https://www.inspire.com/m/Brian/,"Dear members,

Many of us, including myself, have spent a good bit of time in hospitals, as a patient or a caregiver or both, and have ideas about how hospitals can improve.

Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist, healthcare scientist, and health care improvement expert at Yale University, recently asked the following questions on Twitter:

“I am curious to know from patients, especially those recently in the hospital: What do you wish we did better? What were the most obvious ways that quality could be improved throughout hospitalization and in the transition to home? We should all really want to know. What should we improve?”

Harlan’s tweet generated many good replies, and several days ago I asked Harlan what he would think about me posing this question on his behalf here in Inspire. As Harlan is, I’m proud to say, a fan of Inspire, he readily agreed. I invite you to reply to this discussion with answers to the questions he posed, so that we can help to drive positive change in hospitals.

We would like to create a summary from your answers and share them, in an anonymous fashion (no Inspire username), as an essay in a publication, or present the combined insights at a conference. We will let you know of any publication or presentation of this information. Your perspectives matter, and together we can make an impact.

I look forward to reading your thoughts and ideas, and if for any reason you would prefer that we not include your answer in our summary, just write, “Don’t share” in your reply.

Together we're better,

bentley1963,https://www.inspire.com/m/bentley1963/,I see that the new recommendations for cervical screening in women over 30 is either a pap test every 3 years or a pap and hpv test every 5 years. Wouldent it be possible during that time to contact an hpv and then clear it in a year or 2 at which point you would actually be hpv positive for awhile?,"July 6, 2019 at 10:59 pm",1 Reply,"About bentley1963

Brian,https://www.inspire.com/m/Brian/,"Dear members,

As patients and caregivers, we have more sources of medical information available to us than ever before to help us make the best decisions possible for our health.

Advice from our doctors is sometimes not the same as the information we learn from the experiences of our peers, and there are often other sources of information available as well. Some of our decisions feel like big or serious decisions, while others do not. And sometimes, medical decisions have to be made quickly or under pressure. When the stakes are high – life and death, even – it could be scary to think you might make the wrong decision even if there is no clear ‘right’ one.

We’d like to hear how you made medical decisions in your life. Did some sources of information or advice figure more prominently in the process than others? Were some decisions easy, and others hard? How do you know who or what to trust? In retrospect, did you feel you made the right choice, or would you have chosen differently? Could you have chosen differently?

Making medical decisions is a unique and individual process, and sharing your story could help others who are trying to decide what to do.

Together we’re better,
Brian

My bf and I had a rough few weeks and considered taking a break. The thought of even meeting a man and having to explain it all over again to a new person never feels good. The thought of being single after not being single for so long is anxiety-provoking enough. People are crazy. I know there will be a new man who will accept me if we do break up for good. My current bf is suuuper supportive and it helps. Also, I was nervous about children but my daughter came out healthier than ever. They pumped me with a bunch of medication during delivery that helped with making sure the herpes didn’t transmit. Its been 12 years for me. In some ways it’s gotten easier.

mastergousau2,https://www.inspire.com/m/mastergousau2/,"**Attached photo(uncircumcised flaccid penis(foreskin stretched out), u've been warned) is strictly only for viewer/reader's educational and/or ease of reference in relation to my question.

i'm a 28 years old male.

Can someone confirm is this fordyce spot or genital herpes or genital wart ??

BACKGROUND FACTS:
(1)On 18th June 2019 (Tuesday), i got my STD test result through blood test(IgG/IgM test) and came back positive with HSV-1(oral, but without symptom) with an index value of 35.1. Needless to say, i freaked out(felt sad, angry, depressed, embarrassed, hopeless, in denial, etc etc all at the same time). Clinical doctor then referred me to a STD specialist doctor for treatment.

(2) 19th June 2019 (Wednesday), when i went to see the specialist doctor preparing to ask for medication treatment, to my surprise, he immediately and confidently dismissed my previous test result saying that it's false positive after asking whether i have any symptoms for herpes(both oral and genital). I told him i do not but told him to examine my body(waist and above) as i'm not sure the spots on my upper body(waist above) are acne, moles or herpes. The specialist examined my body and confirmed it's not herpes. I have never experienced any cold sores or any itching/pain on my genital areas. He did ask me do i have any lesions on my genitalia area and i verbally described it to him none(do not feel pain, itching or feel any sore) and it doesn't look like those pictures i've googled but did told him i have white spots around my penis shaft n suggested it could be fordyce n he just agreed with me(without examining it though). **NOTE: (1) the white spots around my penis shaft doesnt seem to cause me any pain or any discomfort at all....(2)gotta say though, in my mind i was like ""dafuq?? just like that ?? i really have no herpes despite the report??"" kinda find it hard to believe to my surprise...because just 24 hours ago i was prepared to live a single life for the rest of my life then the next day i'm hearing another news, one heck of a roller coaster of emotion**

(3) In summary, he told me:
(a) i do not have herpes despite my test result saying i have oral herpes,

(b) my previous blood test result is definitely a false positive(yeah, he's so confident to the point he didn't even use words like ""highly unlikely"" or ""unlikely"" n went on to boast his credentials of being a practitioner for STDs for 30 years n being trained by professionals, dealing with over-thinking patients like me, etc etc) because the IgG/IgM test method is obsolete and inaccurate(he went on to give me an example saying that if a weighing scale machine only has 50% chance of being accurate would u still use that weighing scale machine to measure your weight?? kinda make sense to me), and said that the more and most accurate test method is the Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test,

(c) despite the obsolete and inaccurate methods of IgG/IgM test, some general practitioners still do such test because of wanting to earn money,

(d) people without showing any symptoms of herpes(both oral and genital) despite their positive result conducted through IgG/IgM test are false positive results,

(e) that he will only consider conducting a PCR test on me ONLY IF i have any symptoms(lesions, outbreaks,etc) or suspected symptom(then i should only go see him again for a physical examination of the suspected symptom before deciding to conduct a PCR test),

(f) not to go mess around by going for another blood test to get confirmation because of reason mentioned in (b) and the fact that this will cause me psychological anxiety/stress due to over-analysing and told me to stop reading stuff on the internet(lol, but im still here posting this :P)

(g) even if i really do have oral herpes even after a PRC test, then it's still non-harmful and i can still live a normal life, have a family and kids(then he went on further to explain things like half of world population has HSV-1 and how non-harmful it is, the male sperm doesn't carry the herpes, blablabla i don't know he told me lots of stuff i couldn't remember all of it)
**UNRELATED SIDE NOTE: the time i spent talking and consulting with the specialist was around 40minues+, he was actually very down to earth n a chill person**

CONCLUSION:
so because after consulting my doctor, i realised i should've taken a picture of the white/green spots around my penis shaft to show him so he can have a better view for his confirmation rather through my verbal description. That's why, right now, i'm asking the internet/world for your personal opinion....I'm not sure when exactly i have these white spots though, it's quite possible i may have it like few years back especially when i was like 21(2012), still not sure, just a guess,...bottom line i don't know when i have it.....So what's your opinion on the picture ??

Thanks in advance for reading and/or replying this post.

khack2471,https://www.inspire.com/m/khack2471/,"Since I have had hpv on numerous of occasions in the past and experienced genital warts and had them removed, will I be contagious for the rest of my life?

jc1941,https://www.inspire.com/m/jc1941/,"Hello, I am new to the message board but hopefully you all can provide me some insight on some symptoms I am currently having. I would normally go to the doctor but I am in between jobs and have no insurance until the beginning on the month.

About a week ago I started experiencing burning in my genitals, mainly the tip of my penis, pain with ejaculation and urge to pee frequently.There is no discharge and my urine looks normal. I have had the same sex partner for the past 4 1/2 years, my wife was tested during her pregnancy for STDs 3 years ago with negative results. Could this maybe be a UTI? I’m only 32. Is it possible that I have an STD that was dormant for that long?

mastergousau,https://www.inspire.com/m/mastergousau/,"i'm 28 and male, just got diagnosed with HSV-1(oral, and without symptoms...yet). Needless to say, i'm devastated and depressed right now as i'm typing this post.

(1)apart from the expected harsh reality of extreme difficulty of having a wife in future, my biggest concern is: will i be able to still have a healthy child despite me having herpes(assuming by miracle if i have a wife in future)??

(2) will my child be infected too once born ?? or will my child suffer from any other harms due to my herpes ??

(3) will my future wife(not infected with herpes or other types of STD) be infected by me when i have sex with her??

i've been reading the internet saying many people have herpes and do lead normal life blablabla but can't seem to find anything about males with herpes having a child and whether the child n wife is infected or not.....if the child and/or wife will be infected then looks like i'm bound to be single for the rest of my life, which saddens, frustrates, scares me the most.

i can't believe my life is over just like that....FKKK MY LIFE !!!! GOD DAMMIT !!

firstnamelast19,https://www.inspire.com/m/firstnamelast19/,"A few months ago I went to my normal obgyn appointment and got the call back and found out I had chlamydia and my Pap smear and came back abnormal. I know exactly when I contracted it and it was in February of this year. I had been having pelvis pain so I also got a vaginal ultra sound for that but they said everything looked normal and just to come back in a year for another Pap smear. After all that things went back to normal and I tested negative for chlamydia. My pelvis pain has started back and I’ve pretty much gone down a spiral since then. The pain in my pelvis some times goes down my legs. I’ve also read that anxiety can cause pain like this but, I can’t shake the thought that I could have something else like HIV. I never had flu like symptoms or anything like that. But I have had recent problems with my saliva glands and think they may be infected and the more I google the more I see that HIV could be a cause of that. Other than the pelvis pain and my saliva glands I feel normal but I know that doesn’t mean I don’t have anything. I know the best thing I could do is get tested but I’m just so fearful it would come back positive. I was just wondering what everyone else experiences were and has anyone ever been so anxious about something it causes them to have physical symptoms?

I now have a LEEP scheduled in 3 weeks as she believes it will help both the cellular changes and the inflammation, although its my understanding that HPV doesn't cause cervicitis itself.

Brian,https://www.inspire.com/m/Brian/,"Dear members,

How should we be thinking about our genetic information when it comes to disease?

It’s a question many of us are asking here on Inspire, sometimes very intensely, depending on the nature of the disease. The information we get from our genome can have a direct impact on so much, including how, or if, we can be treated for certain types of disease -- that is the nature of precision (or personalized) medicine.

Precision medicine’s appeal is reflected in the way many drugs are developed and which ones work well enough for government approval. In May, the FDA made its first drug approval based on how well the drug targeted a tumor’s genetic features (one kind of “biomarker”) rather than the type of organ tissue the tumor came from. Last year, over a quarter of all the drugs approved by the FDA included biomarker information.

Inspire’s 2016 Annual Survey of members revealed how much genetic testing and precision medicine are on our minds. Of 10,000 respondents, 18% already had their genes tested, 29% had heard of precision medicine, and 58% were interested in finding out more about their genetic makeup.

What is more, many respondents expressed enthusiasm to share their genetic data to help scientific research. Almost 70% said they would share this information and/or their health records for a clinical research project. We expect that figure will climb in the 2017 Inspire Annual Survey, which we plan to publish soon.

Patients’ genetic information could also help answer the question of when we might benefit from advances in precision medicine. Could a breakthrough treatment help someone now? Their children?

Many of us want to be involved in medical innovation and drive decisions that will affect us. Offering access to the intricacies of our genomes is a powerful way to be involved. I feel strongly that if any of us do contribute in this way, researchers must respect our wishes about the ways in which our personal information is used.

But even if sharing genetic information doesn’t appeal to you, sharing your experience with a treatment, asking for more information about a condition, or supporting one another as caregivers helps us learn more about what our genes can tell us. Each of us can help move medicine forward.

I would love to know your thoughts about gene testing, precision medicine, and what it means to share this type of information. Has genetic information factored into your or someone you know’s care in some way? If you’d like, please share your experiences in the comments section below.

Together, we’re better.

Cj333,https://www.inspire.com/m/Cj333/,"Hello everyone. I apologize and will try to make the details as least graphic as possible.

Long story short, I received protected oral from a sex worker. But my concern is that at some point, she sort of sat on my face for a couple of seconds (nude). She then kept insisting I lick her vagina but I was too afraid of HIV, so I only kissed her inner thighs a couple of times, and then I kissed her a single time on the exterior part of her vaginal lips. With my lips tightly closed, and feeling no fluid touch my lips. I never once stuck out my tongue.

Still, I'm a bit afraid of having been exposed to HIV.
1. Would her sitting on my face and receiving a single, closed lip kiss on only the outside surface of the vagina count as cunnilingus? And would it be a risk to test over?

2. I don't recall anything wrong with my mouth, other than slightly chapped lips. Would this be an adequate barrier?

Ninaisdevastated,https://www.inspire.com/m/Ninaisdevastated/,"Hello. My name is Nina and i am 22 years old. Today my life changed forever as i was diagnosed with herpes. Just typing that out is so extremely painful..... for the past 2 years i abstained from sex because of a violent sexual assault left me traumatized... i’ve struggled with depression and anxiety since. But after being put on some medication that helped I decided to start dating again this year. I had a good healthy relationship for about 4 months, but found out he was being unfaithful. And so i started dating someone else, became intimate within the first month, everything was great. Until today. I went to the hospital thinking i had strep throat as i had been very ill the past 3 days, only for them to tell me the worst thing i could possibly imagine. I haven’t stopped crying for hours. I can’t bring myself to tell my mom or my best friend. I’m so disgusted with myself and ashamed...When in relationships, which i have been greatly enjoying this year, i am a highly sexual person. I don’t know how i’ll ever have the same relationships ever again... i would never want to do to someone what this has done to me. I’ll never be able to enjoy the things i used to enjoy with another person. I can’t get over that. I’ll never be able to bring pleasure to anyone the way they’ll want me to. How will anyone ever want me? I wanted to have kids within the next few years, my whole life all i’ve wanted was to be a mother. I feel like that dream has been ripped away from me. My depression and anxiety have come back in full swing. I find myself taking more hydroxixine by the hour just so i can breathe. I don’t know i’m strong enough for this. I honestly don’t know if i can get past it. I feel like my life is over and i’m so young. I had so many plans. I was so happy to be in a relationship. And now i don’t even know how to bring this up, he said he was checked in March and was clean..... i feel like he’ll turn it around on me and say i was cheating and leave me all alone. I just want someone to talk to who knows where i’m coming from. I need to calm down before i lose it","May 18, 2019 at 1:34 pm",6 Replies,"About Ninaisdevastated

Radha_Inspire,https://www.inspire.com/m/Radha_Inspire/,"Greetings! I’d like to introduce a new resource for all of us in the Inspire community - a glossary.

We believe this will be a helpful resource that will improve your experience on Inspire. Thanks to the many, many of you who suggested this feature and helped make it a priority.

Inspire’s glossary includes common terms and acronyms that reflect the shorthand that patients, caregivers, and others who seek support here use to talk about their conditions and experiences. For example, you would find 6MWT (6-minute walking test) but we also included LWASA (let’s wait and see approach).

In creating the glossary, we began with a list of terms compiled by Inspire’s community team from around the site and solicited further suggestions from a few large communities in order to have a baseline group of terms.

You can access the glossary via the drop down menu next to your Inspire username at the top left of the page.



Here is the direct link: https://www.inspire.com/about/glossary

This glossary is very much a work in progress and we would love your help in growing it. So, please visit the page, use the resource, and if you don’t see the term you are looking for or you would like to suggest one, leave it as a comment in response to this post or email glossary@inspire.com. Remember to include the following details:
- Term, abbreviation, or acronym
- If an abbreviation or acronym, a fully spelled out version
- If applicable, a definition

Thank you!

chrisrcrc,https://www.inspire.com/m/chrisrcrc/,"To cut the story short, 38 years old married male tested positive for HSV 1 with a very low index that is 1.1 and I am not even sure if its positive or equivocal. Here are few questions: 

1) What are the chances of a false positive (if its positive and not equivocal) with such low index value. Never ever had any symptoms or outbreak on genitals or lips or anywhere. Had chicken pox in childhood. But that's just it. Had ulcers inside mouths but those were not herpes and was diagnosed as ulcers by doctors and reason was chewing tobacco habit and spicy food but doctors never call it herpes and they were inside mouth like on tongue or inside cheeks but never outside. 

2) Shall I repeat test after a month or so or shall I just ignore it since no symptoms ever happened. In case I do a retest and the results arrive same what shall I do further? Consider it negative? 

3) The reason for carrying out these tests were because of sexually abused by two men forcefully. Shall I test for HSV 2 IGG as well or just don't test it since I read that it is discouraged by doctors to test for herpes unless one have symptoms because of the chances of a false positive result can be very stressful and traumatic. Please advise. 

Please reply in﻿ detail if possi﻿ble. Thanks.

lilmay,https://www.inspire.com/m/lilmay/,"about 2 months ago, I started having unprotected and protected sex with a new person. During this time, I was experiencing a lot of itchiness and some burning. When realizing this, I decided to go to my gynecologist who tested me for all vaginal bacterial infections and all stds. The results came out negative even though I have been having this constant itching and burning on my labia. I have also learned that when I have sex, the itching and burning gets more intense and sometimes my whole vulva would be inflamed for a day or two. My sexual partner also got tested for stds and he was negative as well. I don't know what to do to make this itching and burning stop. I stopped having sex for more than a month now and the problem still hasn't gone away.

But he never has any kind of blisters or sores or pimples or anything related ever on his body. Not before that incident and not now.

Is he positive or if it maybe a false positive? Its been 5 months since the incident so window period for testing is enough I guess. I didn't tell him yet because he is suffering from pneumonia and already stressed.

Please let me know your thoughts. What I read is that if there are no herpes symptoms on body than the tests doesn't mean anything but I am very very very worried. Please help me.

I’m pleased to share with you “Experts by Experience: Patient stories that teach,” a compilation of columns we created in collaboration with Mayo Clinic.

In the foreword, which I co-authored with Lee Aase, Director of Mayo Clinic Social Media Network, we noted that it is our hope that ""these stories will become a powerful tool for patients, to give voice to their experiences, and a resource for healthcare providers, to turn knowledge into action.""

We invite you to read and share this compilation, which you can download here. We call the compilation ""stories that teach"" because patients and caregivers are educators. Every day on Inspire, we learn how patients and caregivers are teaching one another, and sharing how they educate others around them, including medical professionals.

We invite you to comment here on the compilation, and we thank you for being Inspire members.

I of course made my S.O. aware and he had his blood pulled (pretty sure our relationship is out the window because of this) but his results came back negative. We've been sexually active for 5 months and never used protection. I know my doctor did not pull my blood as she explained if i was just recently infected it can take 4 to 6 weeks for antibodies to reach high enough levels to be seen in a blood test. However I'm going to assume I've been a carrier and just recently had my first outbreak. Should i suggest (just as a responsible sexually active adult) that he get retested in 6 weeks or hope his doctor made him aware of the need for a retest?,"February 12, 2019 at 11:46 am",10 Replies,"About breezy2454906

Dear members,
I'm writing to share with you the latest in a series of “Experts by Experience” columns, as part of a collaboration between Inspire and Mayo Clinic.

We invite you to read and share ""Grieving the Loss of Your Physician,"" by Kari Ulrich.

Ms. Ulrich, who lives with multiple disorders, including fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, explores the close relationship she created with her primary care provider, and the sadness and fear she experienced when the physician was no longer be her doctor. ""How does one grieve the loss of a physician, your health care cheerleader, your confidante?"" Ms. Ulrich wrote. ""Health care providers argue that you cannot become involved in patients’ lives, and that patients must understand boundaries in the provider-patient relationship. Nevertheless, we do form relationships, and it is normal to grieve the loss of any relationship, especially when you have shared decades of experiences. I went through the same stages of grief that I would with the death of a family member or a close friend.""

We invite you to comment on Ms. Ulrich's column, and share it and other columns in the series widely.

We also are happy to note that because of the incredible positive reaction to our ""Experts"" collaboration with Mayo, we're increasing the guest column frequency from monthly to two times a month. You can learn more about ""Experts"" here: https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-inspir....

humble77,https://www.inspire.com/m/humble77/,"Hey so I’m a little concerned. About 2 months ago I went to a massage parlor where the masseuse offered a protected bj. I was stupid and agreed. But about a month later my left testical hurt for about ten days straight (maybe epiditimitus), it was tender but only really hurt when I touched it. It then went away for a day or so and then my right testical hurt for about 4 days. I was a little concerned but there were no other symptoms and after the pain went away I didn’t worry about it. However, my girlfriend who’s on birth control just started bleeding between periods. “Spotting” I think it’s called, but she had finished her period and then about ten days later she started bleeding again, and has been for 12 days straight. She has no other symptoms, She believes she’s bleeding because she missed a day of birth control, which could be. I’m just really freaked out that I might have chlamydia and then gave it to my girlfriend. The bj the masseuse gave me was protected, but I’m still very concerned because tender testicals and bleeding between periods are both symptoms of chlamydia. Any thoughts, advice or just care to share related experiences would be really appreciated!","April 18, 2019 at 6:37 pm",2 Replies,"About humble77

I went to my primary care dr told him about them he looked said they look like herpes. I was with my mother i instantly said no way. I’ve always gotten tested for stds. Well i guess not tested for herpes. A week later i get a call from my dr he says i have been exposed to the herpes virus. He doesn’t go into much detail I am in shock. I’m not sure how who when where because from research you have it and never know for weeks months years. I just don’t really believe this. I’m not sure what to do next.

And why me. my dr says i don’t need to take any meds and that I’ll be fine and to do some research and call him back. I guess you can say i had an outbreak but i wasn’t in much pain that’s why i didn’t think it was herpes. I was hoping and praying it was non sexually acquired ulcers.

Hez89,https://www.inspire.com/m/Hez89/,"Hi community,

3 years ago I had a short-time relationship with a woman. We didn't have sex but we had oral sex. Afterwards she told me that her PAP test showed some anomalies (nothing too serious I think). At that time I didn't worried too much because we had ""just"" oral sex so I didn't thought of the possibility of being infected by her by HPV. Today, after 3 years I read an article about HPV and that it can be transmitted by oral sex which I didn't know at that time. So is it possible that she infected me with her HPV virus 3 years ago? The problem is that shortly after the relationship with this woman I got together with my now girlfriend and I fear that maybe I could have infected her without knowing? I am feeling down and I don't know what to do... I know that her last PAP tests were normal and showed no anomaly so maybe I am just worrying too much? Can I assume that everything is alright as her Pap tests were good? What should I do?

Ps. I never experienced any symptoms and neither did my girlfriend.

Thanks in advance for all your help, appreciate it.","March 28, 2019 at 2:46 pm",11 Replies,"About Hez89

peach_Jr,https://www.inspire.com/m/peach_Jr/,"I've had sex for a few times (could count it on one hand), and recently, my partner said he had been tested positive for chlamydia. The only intercourse we did was raw anal sex. I went for a full STI screening for the first time (he was my only partner so I didn't really felt the need to take any screenings before he told me about his chlamydia infection) and was declared negative for all STIs except for a minor infection. However, he only took a swab in the vagina. Would it be possible if chlamydia was overlooked because the doctor didn't swab my anus, or would it still produce the same negative result?","April 5, 2019 at 3:09 pm",1 Reply,"About peach_Jr

Fredo101,https://www.inspire.com/m/Fredo101/,"This STD Awareness Month, we’re launching year three of our YES Means TEST campaign to raise awareness about the importance of STD testing. And we need your help!

As part of the campaign, we’d like to share the stories of people who have had an STD – including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Trich or MGEN. The goal is to help demonstrate how common it is to get an STD; as well as to reinforce the importance of testing from credible and outspoken women. After all, it’s one of the best ways to take care of one’s sexual health!

If you’ve tested positive for one of the four STDs mentioned above and are willing to share your story – with our team and potentially with reporters at media outlets targeting young women – please let us know. We’d love to share more information about what we hope to do in April, and how you might be able to participate. Just email us at info@ashasexualhealth.org message us here on Inspire.

We need your help to break down the stigma of STDs and barriers to getting tested. Thank you for your consideration!","April 2, 2019 at 3:38 pm",0 Replies,"About Fredo101

questions2000,https://www.inspire.com/m/questions2000/,"I had genital bumps and saw 3 different Gynos for a total of 5-6 appointments to attempt to identify what the bumps were. None of them were able to give me a definitive answer. One said molluscum contagiousum, one said HPV or skin tags and one said she didn’t know. The bumps eventually went away on their own after 2-3 years. I had two Pap smears over that time that both came back normal.

I was with the same boyfriend for 5 years and he never developed bumps to this day. We both got tested before doing anything and both came back negative. About a year into our relationship I started developing the bumps.

I am now single and unsure of how to approach this conversation with future partners as I am not even sure if I have hpv or not. Is this something I need to disclose? How do I even begin the conversation?

balanitisHPV,https://www.inspire.com/m/balanitisHPV/,"As a man, all I was ever told was that HPV is something that affects women. But. . . I have balanitis: painful red inflamed tip of my penis. It looks awful and itches all the time (like a yeast infection). Sometimes the tip feels like a piercing pain. My wife and I had an active sex life before I got balanitis 3 months ago. Tried intercourse twice in 3 months (with condom). . . the tip felt so painful I had to stop. The pain lingers on for a day afterward. I went to primary care doctor and had tests. He said ""balanitis is usually STD"" but all the tests were negative. Went to a urologist and he was dismissive because my tests were negative. I had to beg him to even examine my penis! He did and said it looked like a yeast infection (this is the go-to throwaway diagnosis for doctors). Gave me diflucan . . took 3 weeks and no response. Asked him for biopsy and he did one of my BLADDER not my penis. Said yeast would show up in the urine culture (although fungal culture of surface infection is better). Doctors are all cookie cutter and the max appointment time is 10 minutes.

The ONLY test I took that was positive was High Risk HPV 31, 68. There is no FDA approved test for men so doctors and insurance companies won't do it. I ordered one from a certified lab and read the medical literature on how to best test a penis for high risk HPV (use an emery board to loosen penile skin, then the cytobrush that came from the online lab company.

Here's the thing: Back in the 1990s, there were small studies of balanitis in men that found HPV in most men with persistent balanitis after all other potential causes eliminated. The authors stated that further research was necessary to show HPV-balanitis link.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8031918

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8039781

25 years went by and . . no research. There is little literature on balanitis and almost none on HPV's effects on men. The HPV/balanitis that I have now was compared to the HPV vaginitis that doctors accept with women. But since it is not well studied, my urologist says ""HPV in men can only cause warts or cancer, that's it.""

So I have high risk HPV and nothing else. The balanitis has destroyed my sex life and is uncomfortable day and night.

I am taking AHCC extract but herbal supplements have never done anything for me in the past.

Are there any men out there with balanitis of unknown cause? If so, get yourself tested for HPV.

The bad news: if it is HPV causing your balanitis, they can't do anything. Women can have LEEP and other procedures but because doctors deny HPV is causing balanitis, they won't work on the HPV-infected skin at the tip of the penis.","December 29, 2018 at 4:14 pm",6 Replies,"About balanitisHPV

BTru,https://www.inspire.com/m/BTru/,"When I was 16 I was told I had herpes and it was crushing however I did my research and found hope with medicine and safe sex, but about 4 months ago I had odd bumps that weren't going away and went to the doctor to find out i have HPV causing genital warts. The doctors made it seem like my only option was removal and then when i found out i could never afford it i did research online for a cream or other medication and found something i have been using for a few days and seems to be helping. So i now have herpes and genital warts that according to my research is possible to come back whenever and it has just absolutely crushed me because i was newly 18 and got dumped right before i found out so now i feel as if i will be alone for the rest of my life when i just started it because i cant fathom a single reasonable human being okay with all of this considering their is a high chance i can transfer genital warts or HPV as the doctors diagnosed me.","March 25, 2019 at 7:50 pm",2 Replies,"About BTru

kelloh,https://www.inspire.com/m/kelloh/,"I was diagnosed with HSV-2, four months ago to the day. My nanny self is already a germ-phobe and constantly washing my hands, but as soon as the nurses told me my OCD turned into a nightmare.

I'm caring for two babies, and every time that I change their diapers, or apply diaper cream, almost makes me pass out. My fight or flight response is in full blast, even though I knew I washed my hands 10X before I changed him.

Can you (the infected) transmit HSV-2 through your hands? It sounds dumb, but the paranoia I've gotten from reading more into it doesn't answer the anxiety specific questions that pop into my head all the time. Cuticles, under nails, small cuts, dry hands?

I've gotten latex gloves for when I change the babies, so that's helping the anxiety a bit more. But the diaper rashes are killing me every time, the ""what if this is from you?"" is popping into my head constantly.

I'm talking to my counselor about it, and am trying to come to terms slowly but surely.

The use of it made a has very clearly aggravated my latent herpes infection. That is, I had nothing the day I used it, then about 3 days later, I had a nasty outbreak.

I can’t say if it was the pressure on the base of the pump, the vacuum caused by the pump, or a combination of the two.

chia87,https://www.inspire.com/m/chia87/,"Hi everyone,

I tested for STDs and HSV last week due to having an unprotected intercourse. There was no signs of irritation or pain or any discharge or sores. I started having little red spot on my skin, started with thigh and few more on belly. My doctor thought I had an yeast infection and prescribed accordingly and the test result came. I don't know the actual number but HSV 2 came out positive (higher than normal). I am doing research and seeing many of them could be false positive. Can you guys give me some thought about this?","February 11, 2019 at 7:06 pm",3 Replies,"About chia87

I went to doc and they did a urinalysis and a test for c. trachomatis/n. gonorrhoeae by amp dna and all came out negative. I went to urologist and he did some prostate massage thing and said I have some puss in my liquid expression and gave me antibiotics for prostatitis.

bigal3000,https://www.inspire.com/m/bigal3000/,"In my case, I have genital herpes. Got it from my last girlfriend two years ago. Fortunately the outbreaks have been relatively mild, but is something I’d rather live without, nonetheless.

Wondering what people generally do to minimize the outbreak.

Time?

Lysine?

Antivirals?

My girlfriend had HSV1 and she said that lysine was best for her, but still had nasty outbreaks.

I have tried using a Virulite but that had very limited if any positive effect on my genital outbreaks.

I can’t just wait for these things to pass, so I get a little nasty. I use an antiseptic called “Dettol” (although an alcohol may be similar) and apply it to the outbreak to prevent contamination (prevent the virus from spreading to my hands and other areas). I then burst open the sores and flood the area with antiseptic.

What generally happens is that the sore immediately stops itching, and then dries and scabs over.

I have noticed that the next outbreak is at a slightly different site (usually it would recur at the same site).

This is not something I recommend, and please be responsible doing anything about your own situation, but I just want to put it out there. Not the herpes...","February 7, 2019 at 8:30 am",1 Reply,"About bigal3000

Chronic-Inspire,https://www.inspire.com/m/Chronic-Inspire/,"By Radha_Inspire
Digital Editor, Inspire

Dr. Melissa Geraghty is a licensed clinical health psychologist with expertise in pain psychotherapy. She has a deeply personal interest in her work with patients as someone with multiple chronic pain conditions herself. Chronic pain and its treatment is poorly understood in general – the mental and emotional aspect even less so.

Dr. Geraghty, who practices at Rago & Associates in Naperville, Illinois spoke with me about what a pain psychologist does and how good mental health care is part of chronic pain treatment.

What is a pain psychologist and what do you do?
My psychotherapeutic style is based on Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT). I teach patients to focus on living one's values and how to function despite pain. This increases a person’s quality of life by learning how to still do things one cares about despite pain levels.

I teach coping skills [like behavioral therapies,] mindfulness, experiential therapy, exposure therapy, expressive therapy, etc. I also assist patients in grieving the loss of their old, able-bodied self. We explore how to increase awareness of body functioning and sensations, and how to pace oneself in daily life and any upcoming events.

As needed, I provide couples therapy and/or family therapy to increase their families understanding of pain and how their family can be supportive. I discuss how, while physical pain is not a choice, we can work on our psychological suffering to improve our mental well-being and overall functioning. I also make sure my patients have a proper medical team, help them navigate the medical system, mentally prepare patients for procedures and surgeries, and I do my best to coordinate care amongst all healthcare professionals. I also treat any comorbid psychological conditions, such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc. We also process the implications of having an invisible disability or a disability that requires mobility assistance, such as how to deal with comments from strangers if a patient with an invisible disability has a handicap parking placard. The list goes on!!

Are you sought out or do you get referrals? In other words, do people know about pain psychologist or are they unaware of the resource?
Most people have not heard of a pain psychologist, sadly. In many cases, by the time the patient has reached me, they have been to several medical doctors, psychologists or counselors, physical therapists, etc, and they had many unfortunate experiences with medical professionals. People typically find me through word of mouth.

What are the first few appointments with you like? What are the goals?
My goal in the first few appointments is to gather a biopsychosocialspiritual history on the patient. We get to know one another better and discuss how treatment will be customized to their needs. I also ask what they hope to get out of therapy.

Are people resistant to or skeptical of the value of pain psychology?
Yes. Many people assume I will think the pain is all in their heads and they have a conversion disorder and will be dismissed. I have never met a patient in pain that was faking. It can also be difficult for people with pain to understand just how interconnected physical pain and emotional pain is. When a person is able to target their psychologically suffering, they are able to more fully live life despite pain.

Many people also have been exposed to pop psychology ideas of, for example, mindfulness. They try it once, say it didn’t help, and dismiss it… The true focus of mindfulness is on experiencing all mental and physical states and building resiliency. I have to spend a lot of time at the start of therapy addressing myths such as this.

How do you think your own history of chronic conditions and chronic pain this has influenced your practice and career?
I have well over 20 medical conditions that involve pain, including: Fibromyalgia, CRPS, ME/CFS, Chronic Migraine… Being able to relate to closely to my patients allows them to feel comfortable bringing up any topic to me as they know I will not judge them.

My patients and their families also look at me as hope, that if I can be a doctor despite my numerous pain conditions, they can also live their values. I’m very open and honest about how life with chronic pain is not easy, and there are many days I absolutely struggle, but I also fall back on the coping skills and strategies I teach my patients.

balanitisHPV,https://www.inspire.com/m/balanitisHPV/,"All STD and fungal tests negative.
HPV positive (type 31 and 68).

One diagnosis is Bowen Disease / Erythroplasis of Queryat (HPV penis). From what I can tell, this is a very early stage skin cancer. Unfortunately, it is at the tip of my penis (a lesion surrounding my urethra). :(

I always heard that penile cancer is EXTREMELY rare - as in 1 out of 100,000 AND circumcision makes it even less likely. HOWEVER, it seems they don't count this more common skin cancer of the penis as ""penile cancer"" unless it invades the inside of the penis. This is nuts! Glans resurfacing or partial/whole remove of the penis is required if topical chemotherapy doesn't work.

Anyone here with cancer or precancer of the penis?

Heres where im now starting to freak out

Last Weekend i went to a wedding, a very cold wedding at night, and I got a fever and chills, along with a strep throat. Ive had strep throat all the time since i was a kid , and i get it from eating a lot of sugary food and candy which i did at the wedding. Next day, went to walk in clinic and was prescribed antibiotics for my throat, and advil for fever. So its been 11 months since last time i had sex without a condom and now im worried, is it a coincidence I am getting the fever, and the strep throat? along with catching them together? Should i be worried that my chances of having HIV are high? Ive also lost 20 pounds from september till december, and in that timeframe i also took up a manual labour job full time monday to friday, along with playing sports again, but even the weight loss is concerning me. Ive never had any rashes, i had diarhhea a couple times in december but i was eating terrible for a couple days of my exam, but now my digestion is fine. Is the chance of me having HIV high or are these just a coincidence? Please someone help, I am freaking out, cannot sleep, cannot focus in school, and i just wanna crawl in my bed and never leave because I am so worried about this","January 16, 2019 at 11:37 am",2 Replies,"About jamessmorenbu

JohnNovack,https://www.inspire.com/m/JohnNovack/,"Dear members,
I'm writing to share with you the latest in the twice-monthly series of “Experts by Experience” columns, as part of a collaboration between Inspire and Mayo Clinic.

""Stepping into Self-Advocacy"" tells the story of Kate Sheridan, a young adult who struggled with a serious autoimmune condition triggered by Lyme disease. Looking for ways to connect and communicate more effectively with her care team helped her become more of an advocate in her own care, a goal we see many Inspire members discuss every day across our communities.

""The future of medicine,"" Kate wrote, ""seems focused on health technology, robotic surgeries, telemedicine, implants, and transplants…and rightly so. But in my experience, finding simple and meaningful ways to connect can be just as powerful.""

Also, please see another new column, ""I Tried To Quit My Job Because Of Psoriasis, But Thankfully, They Wouldn't Let Me,"" in Folks, a Pillpack magazine, as part of a brand new collaboration between Inspire and Folks. The author of that column, Howard Chang, is church minister and an advocate with National Psoriasis Foundation, an Inspire partner.

""A lot of times when someone comes to you with a problem,"" Howard wrote, ""you want to fix it for them, but that’s not usually what they’re after: tangible help is nice, yes, but what they really want is is your understanding and empathy.""

We invite you to comment on these columns, and share them as you see fit. Thanks, as always, for being Inspire members.

Hummingbirdthequeen,https://www.inspire.com/m/Hummingbirdthequeen/,"I'm having another herpes genital breakout today. Only my fourth one since originally diagnosed but my second one in less than 6 months. I went 16 years after initial breakout and diagnosis without having another one until I got remarried 3 years ago and was under an extreme amount of stress and I know I'm under a huge amount of stress now as well which is to the only reason I can figure I'm having another one so close to the last one. Even though I know I have it, I've known I've had it since 2000. I was diagnosed while going thru my divorce and because of the circumstances surrounding it I have no doubt who it came from but it's still just as equally devastating to me today knowing a breakout is starting as it was when I was first diagnosed. I cry and get really depressed each time I have one. I don't know if it's because I feel it's unfair. I had only been with one person when I got this and was left with this nice little gift that will affect me for the rest of my life while he has no symptoms at all or because it's a reminder of how I just wasn't enough for him that he felt the need to be with multitudes of women unprotected while we were married? Along with even though I know the stigma is worse than the disease actually is and it's more common and widespread then people realize and my current husband doesn't make me feel this way but I still feel dirty & embarrassed but most of all still very angry, not to mention my last two have been very painful &uncomfortable even with medication so I'm constantly reminded 24/7 it's there until it starts healing which adds to my depression and I don't know how to change any of that. I don't understand why I still do not handle it well whenever I have a breakout and I don't know how to not be upset and more depressed the entire time when having a breakout like the one that has started today.","January 12, 2019 at 7:30 am",1 Reply,"About Hummingbirdthequeen

Who knew getting sick could require the combined skills of a librarian and an archivist?

If that isn’t you, managing the paperwork that comes with medical care can be a Herculean task.

“In so many ways, you’re powerless,” said J.J. Jackson, an organization professional in the Washington D.C. area and owner of Paperwork Maven. “Especially people who have a lot of doctor’s appointments, they’re really sick and just don’t have the energy to do all this stuff… It’s so frustrating and it takes emotional time.”

Jackson said getting on top of medical paperwork – mainly, knowing where things are, what is complete, and what is not – can help people reclaim some power.

“It definitely empowers me,” Jackson said, because tracking her information gives her a complete picture of her medical and financial situation and she can speak with confidence about tests, needs, and money paid and owed.

“At least the knowing, that gives you a kind of power.”

Having medical paperwork organized can also reduce stress and even save money, Jackson said. Here, she discussed important strategies to begin tackling medical paperwork.

Put everything in one place
At minimum, having everything together is critical, Jackson said. This could be the point where some people stop; it might be a starting point for others to organize further. But as long as everything is in one spot – a box, a folder, a digital file – you can get to it later.

Set aside time for paperwork (it’s probably less than you think)
Time is the number one thing that Jackson said gets in her way.

For someone who has regular medical appointments and a paperwork backlog of several months, Jackson estimated about three hours of concentrated work to organize paperwork into a system. However, once the system is in place, it may require less than 30 minutes per week to log and file new information. In her experience, Jackson said calling insurance companies takes up the most time.

A Table of Contents is your best friend
Ideally, a system for paperwork would have an easy-to-skim main document to which related materials like receipts, Explanation of Benefits statements, medical reports, and images can be traced. This also makes it easy for others to figure out your medical picture, if necessary. It can be physical or digital.

Through her personal and professional experience, Jackson created a simple spreadsheet to track claims, a few claim details, and payments. Each line item corresponds to one day. Jackson labels related documents with the same line item so she knows what claim they correspond to. She won’t check off a line item until each task and payment associated with it is resolved.

“It’s about making sure you have enough detail to track things needing attention and things that are done,” she said,


J.J. Jackson created a chart to organize and track her medical paperwork.

Delegate!
Many people don’t realize they can and should delegate paperwork-related tasks. But, Jackson said, consider that having your medical paperwork in order is important enough to devote resources to it.

“I think people think they ought to be able to do it themselves,” she said. “It’s ok if you don’t want to do it. If someone is sick, I think it would be such a gift to them. If they just don’t have time or energy or the emotional capability doing that, as a family member or friend, that is an excellent gift to give.”

Expert resources from organizations like the National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals and the American Association of Daily Money Managers could be of use said Jackson, who enlists help for medical tasks herself. And depending how comfortable you are letting others see sensitive personal health information, hiring someone to sort, log, file, and do general paperwork-related tasks could also help.

Physical vs digital systems
Digital organization and cloud storage will be the way of the future, Jackson said. The challenge right now is that medical information is spread over multiple locations and multiple types (paper receipts and reports, emails, digital image files, audio recordings, and personal notes, to name a few) and there aren’t good ways to integrate these in one system.

Jackson has separate locations for physical and digital materials but sticks to the same labeling system that corresponds to her main chart. If you’re really committed to a paperless system, a good scanner is essential, Jackson said. A robust organization system should accommodate how you like to store and track your materials and adapt to changes in health needs over time.


Except for those who enjoy detailed organization work, Jackson admits getting medical paperwork organized is not fun. Rather, it’s a means to an end.

“The feeling I get when I’m done is really satisfying,” she said. “I feel accomplished and I feel empowered and like I have peace of mind.”

We are the team behind this site. We feel very fortunate to be able to work on a project that can make a real difference in helping people to live their lives happily.

Inspire was created in 2005 by a group of friends. We were each dealing with important medical issues in our families, and we found that while the Internet was a useful source for authoritative medical information, it was not a safe, welcoming place for us to find support.

We created Inspire to change all that. We envisioned a place where we as patients, caregivers, family and friends could support one another, and where we could do so in a safe, secure, privacy-protected environment.

We are dedicated to building the best online health communities possible. Like our community members, all of us have faced health challenges of our own - and we know from personal experience how valuable the support and encouragement of others can be.

Our tagline, 'Together We're Better', is at the heart of what we do."

jjj5000_rides_trucks,https://www.inspire.com/m/jjj5000_rides_trucks/,"I received a handjob today, and while it was mostly done with her hands, it seemed the girl's mouth rested slightly on the tip of my penis (couldn't see because her hair covered my ability to see) and I felt a warm sensation. It seemed she licked the tip of my penis. And maybe even her lips rested on the tip, maybe even a little tongue as well. I thought she was going to give me a blow job, but that's all she did and then she continued to give me a handjob. I'm worried I could get an STD from this.

If she were to have an STD, would I be at risk from that interaction?","December 31, 2018 at 7:24 pm",1 Reply,"About jjj5000_rides_trucks

GettingThere123,https://www.inspire.com/m/GettingThere123/,"Hi, I was just diagnosed with genital warts this week. It has been an awful few days. I had a small wart that was discovered during a routine physical and I didn't know it was there.

A woman I've been seeing, who I care about very much, was exposed to this before my HPV was discovered. I'm terrified for her own health and plan to make that in the forefront of our conversation together. But I'm also having a terrible time coping with the fact that she may never want to see me again or will react negatively.

Does anyone have advice who has been through this?

phate000,https://www.inspire.com/m/phate000/,"’m a little freaked out. About 3 weeks ago I had a one night stand and the condom broke at one point.

I noticed some itching and urethra pain and decided to go for an STD check 2 weeks later. It came back negative for everything.

The symptoms persisted so I decided to get a second opinion. Three weeks after initial exposure I got retested somewhere else and they notified me the RPR quant test was reactive 1:1 for syphillis. I went in for a follow up this morning to specifically test for tremo palladium which is the bacteria that causes syphillis.

I called my doctor and asked her about my initial STD test result done the first time and she said The test I did initially tested for tremo palladium and it was more accurate than RPR and she wasn’t worried.

My question is that is it possible the antibodies to syphillis did not show up until around week 3? Was week 2 too soon to catch it?","December 12, 2018 at 9:38 pm",3 Replies,"About phate000

STD_Anxious,https://www.inspire.com/m/STD_Anxious/,"Hello,

During my last sexual encounter which was due to fantasies with a pre op trans woman, I have made the following tests:

1. HIV PCR and VDRL at day 8, All negative
2. HIV 1/2 COMBO/DUO Test at day 28, All negative
3. HIV COMBO/DUO , VDLR, Hep B and Hep C at day 94, All negative
4. HIV COMBO/DUO at day 101, Negative.

So basically all is negative, but I still have anxiety that I could have messed something with the window period.

Are HIV and VDRL conclusive after 3 months period?

cityboy1994,https://www.inspire.com/m/cityboy1994/,"On October 13th I heavily made out with a girl who had a cold sore when I was extremely drunk and couldn’t notice it. She didn’t tell me she had one and then continued to give me oral sex for about 2 minutes until she stopped.

I know I have probably contracted it orally (no symptoms orally yet) but is there a chance that I did not contract it genitally?

It’s been 1 month officially since then and the only symptom I believe I am experiencing right now is a once in a while itch and the constant need to pee (which could just be from the heavy stress and depression and anxiety that I’m feeling about having this).

What makes me angry is that I can’t even get a blood test done to see if I’m asymptomatic genitally because the result will definitely show it HSV but it could be one, or the other, or both.

I’m also going into a long term relationship and I really don’t want to infect her if I am asymptomatic especially since I don’t know how long I will be like this for. I’m reading some people have been asymptomatic for years until a sore comes out and that scares the fuck out of me because it’s only been 4 weeks and I’m literally consumed by this. I can’t focus, eat, sleep or do anything without having the thought of this in the back of my head.

I try to tell myself it’s just a skin condition, it’ll hurt, it’s my fault I wasn’t careful but there are pills for it and people take pills for stuff everyday.

Any advice or anything response to any of the above would be extremely helpful. The first couple of nights since I was exposed had been the hardest. Depression, sucicidal thoughts, how would I ever even fathom telling the girl that loves me, the thought of her rejecting me, the thought my family will eventually find out and think I’ve ruined my life and the thought I could never have kids without infecting my future wife would then infect my future kids.

Anything. Please.","November 12, 2018 at 7:24 pm",1 Reply,"About cityboy1994

Most likely , they are infected just like us, just dont know it yet! .. Herpes put fear factors in our minds and hearts which made us scared of the naked truth.

bgr92,https://www.inspire.com/m/bgr92/,"I am 25 years old and became diagnosed with HPV 2 years ago now. I had sex once, with one person, wearing a condom. 2 years later when I had my yearly pap it had come back abnormal. I understand skin to skin contact can still happen even if you wear a condom but my progression has been extreme. The cervical biopsies were CIN 3 (pre-cancerous), i have undergone 2 cryotherapy sessions in my cervix with not luck of beating this thing. I also developed both vulvar and anal lesions. All have been VIN 3 (vulvar intraepitheleal neoplasm - precancerous) and AIN 3 (anal intraepitheleal neoplasm - precancerous). I have undergone 3 partial vulvectomies with laser treatment of both vulva, perianal area, and clitoris (most painful and lost feeling). My biopsies every 4 months are stil high risk at a 3. I recently had a sigmoidoscopy (rectal screening) with 23 biopsies done for mapping. My OBGYN-oncologist, OBGYN, and rectal specialist all think the next step will be a LEEP procedure (cutting of my cervix), possible anal grafting with the worst case possible being anus removal with a colostomy bag, and a possible total vulvectomy. I have not lived a normal sex life at all. I am at a loss. I am unable to function normally. I get reminded every so often of this disease, as I try to live normally my privates either throb in pain or I have to think how to break it to a possible new love prospect. I need help and no one understands. My family think I have a curse on me and swear my worries will be removed by seeing a witch, shaman, or voodoo.

JerseyBoy20,https://www.inspire.com/m/JerseyBoy20/,"Hello,
Recently my girlfriend of six months has developed an aggressive UTI, which she in turn asked for me to get tested in order to ensure I am not the cause. While the UTI test came back negative, I am now worried that I may have potentially carried gonorrhea asymptomatically. While she has been tested since we met and returned negative results for all of the tests I fear I might have contracted gonorrhea years ago. Approximately two years ago was the last person I had unprotected sex with other than my current girlfriend, after the hookup with her she had informed me about two months later that her current partner tested positive for gonorrhea, however, she claimed the new partner happened weeks after we had hooked up. Due to this and showing no symptoms of any sort, I dismissed it, as I was unaware gonorrhea could remain asymptomatic. Which brings me to my current question, would it be in any way possible that I carried the disease for two years with no knowledge of it? I understand my current partner's negative results mean such a situation is extremely unlikely, I have also performed a test today and awaiting results. However, I am curious if such a situation is at all feasible?","October 5, 2018 at 11:07 pm",2 Replies,"About JerseyBoy20

I just wish this feeling of being an outcast for the rest of my life would go away.","October 1, 2018 at 6:47 pm",1 Reply,"About TRN2018

I'm writing to share with you the latest in the twice-monthly series of “Experts by Experience” columns, as part of a collaboration between Inspire and Mayo Clinic.

We invite you to read and share, ""The Choice and Challenge of Being 'Good Enough'- A Caregiving Story,"" by Scott Phillips.

""Caregiving arrived without fanfare on her birthday–a June day in 2002–when my wife was diagnosed with brain cancer,"" Mr. Phillips wrote. ""It was in one of the small consultation rooms that I first heard the word ‘caregiver’ as my wife lay in a coma in the ICU, while I vacillated between being brave and despondent. There was no training, no employee manual or job description. Just, 'You’re her caregiver.'""

Also, please see a new column in the Philadelphia Inquirer, ""Opioids are the only way he can manage his cancer pain. Stigma creates more problems,"" that appeared just today as part of our collaboration with the Inquirer.

Last but not least, we invite you to check out, ""Empowering Patients At The Time Of Diagnosis,"" by rare disease patient advocate Chris Anselmo. The column appeared recently in Life Science Leader magazine as part of the ""Patient Perspectives"" series, in partnership with Inspire.

We invite you to comment on the columns, and share them as you see fit. Thanks for being Inspire members.

Over the past 7 months, I have developed worsening pain in joints which started in the front of my hips and lower back. The pain has spread to back of hips and thoracic back region. I have intermittent pain in one of my left ribs, and left elbow. Pain in hips and back exacerbated by exercise but is also waking me up at night. pain worsened by sitting long periods. The pain is a 5 out of 10 but is always with me. Relevant facts about me:
1. 41 y.o. male in excellent physical condition at 151lbs 5 foot 7 in, with workouts 5-6 days per week before onset of symptoms. Active in physical fitness for 20 years. Good blood pressure and cholesterol.
2. I was a light smoker for 10 years and by light smoker I mean 1-2 cigarettes per day. Pack history less than 3 years. I have no respiratory issues whatsoever.
3. legg-calve perthes disease right hip as child successfully treated.
4. No history of any chronic disease and no identified cancer in ancestry through cursory review.
5. healthy appetite and minor weight loss (5 lbs)
6. Extreme anxiety and panic attacks over symptoms and recently treated with prescribed meds which have helped with anxiety but not physical manifestations.
7. MRI of pelvis and lumbar indicate no issues with sacroiliac region, but did identify bilateral cam type impingement (FAI) and posterior impingement in hips. Mild tendonopathy in right gluteus medius.
8.MRI in #7 above detected abnormal diffuse bone marrow signal abnormality (low T1 signal) in visualized portions of spine which spared the femurs. heterogenous and non-specific. Subsequent Oncologist workup included physical exam and complete skeletal bone scan revealing only mild uptake in hips lumbar and AC joints indicative of mild degenerative change. No focal uptake. Hemo/Oncologist recommended no further testing.
9. MRI of right shoulder indicated early distal clavicular osteolysis in right shoulder and rotator cuff tendonopathy. Prescribed therapy yielded moderate relief but returned when I stopped therapy over concern of worsening symptoms in other joints listed herein.
10. Multiple CBC's throughout the process and urinalysis at my request indicate absolutely no measurements outside of ranges, aside from slightly low Vitamin D which has been corrected through supplementation.
11. Rheumatologist testing for AS biomarker negative and is of the opinion problems are of no auto-immune origin, nor are they osteoarthritis. Referral to Orthopedic surgeon.
12. Orthopedic surgeon appointment is forthcoming in 2 weeks to evaluate next steps in testing.
13. Slight nausea and sleepiness and headache i attribute to side effects of anxiety meds listed on the labels.
14. Do not believe this is psychosomatic as I am an otherwise happy, active, wealthy young man so blessed in my life.

I have no diagnosis- only constant pain. After visit to orthopedic I am considering requesting a bone marrow biopsy and multiple myeloma blood tests at my own expense in response to T1 signal abnormality described above."

la_china23,https://www.inspire.com/m/la_china23/,"Hello, I have been researching online about how contracting herpes type 2 impacts a brittle Diabetic, but haven't been successful in finding any pertinent information. My partner is a brittle diabetic and is very concerned about having sexual intercourse with me, given my recent diagnosis of HSV-2. I have been taking suppressive medications daily and haven't had any outbreaks, since my first one, 8 months ago. We have been using condoms 50% of the time. I know that he has a weakened immune system which makes him more susceptible in contracting it from me and the stigma attached to contracting it isn't helping. I've read that with use of medication and condoms there is a very low chance of transmission as long as there is no visible outbreak.

Is there any evidence based information for him and I to learn more about him contracting it given his condition and if he does contract it, what the difference would be on how it could impact his health versus how a healthy person contracting it?","August 7, 2018 at 6:03 pm",1 Reply,"About la_china23

I've read some things that these infections can give similar results to chlamydia and gonorrhea, but it's not standard practice to test for these. My question is, would a standard urinalysis detect something is wrong if I did have either of these, or would the lab need to specifically test for these conditions?

1346partial,https://www.inspire.com/m/1346partial/,"Hello, everyone!
I'm a 21 year-old female and I just found out I have HPV a month ago. I started feeling horrible pain during intercourse about six months ago and at the time I assumed it was candida because it was itching and appeared after an antibiotics treatment for amygdalitis (it wouldn't have been the first time) so I went for some over the counter self-medication(idelyn gel and canesten). After a month of not seeing any results, I decided to pay my ob/gyn a visit. At first, after running a microbiological exam she told me it was a bacterial infection (because of the existence of negative Gram bacils?) and gave me vaginal suppositories to take for a week. I returned because there was no relief. She said I needed stronger medication and gave me antibiotics for another week (vaginal administration) and other suppositories for balancing my flora. After another failed treatment and another test she said it was a viral infection, and gave me glizigen, an anti viral spray with licorice extract (topic administration). There was some amelioration, but after a month I was no far from where I started so I went back to my ob/gyn. In these 4 months she also checked me for cysts, but there weren't any. After another test she told it was HPV, gave me isopropinosene, to fight with the virus by boosting my immunity for six weeks with breaks every two weeks and it has been a month now and I see no change. My ob/gyn told me she should know soon enough its type. Also, besides painful intercourse, I had no other symptoms like warts, abnormal discharge, fishy smells. My periods were regular. I only had one sexual partener(my actual boyfriend of two years who is really supportive and patient) and he doesn't have HPV (we always use condoms). Do you have any advice? Because it's been a long and confusing time feeling like I'm going nowhere","July 31, 2018 at 6:50 am",1 Reply,"About 1346partial

Brian,https://www.inspire.com/m/Brian/,"Members,

This afternoon, we will remove all tags from Inspire until we can better address the concerns you have raised, and give you more control over this feature. I am sorry that we launched this feature too quickly, without enough member feedback, and I thank all of you who took the time to voice your opinions and give us helpful feedback.

With this in mind, there are a few things I’d like to discuss.

What was the point of tags, anyway? We created tags in order to give you another way to search for what you need. Clicking on tags was meant to be convenient, fast, and accurate. But two out of three is not good enough: regarding accuracy, we have been working continuously to remove all the irrelevant and off-topic tags. We should have removed those off-topic tags before making the feature available. We also wanted tags to be something members could add to their own posts in order to help other members find useful things to read.

Member involvement: We did a lot of testing before launching this new feature, but clearly not enough. To many members, it seemed that tags appeared suddenly, with little or no consideration of whether they would be appreciated. And so we have changed our plans for creating future features. Part of these plans are to greatly expand member testing. Our first member focus group is scheduled for May 24. If you would like to get involved with future member testing, please reach out to team@inspire.com.

Privacy: Nothing has changed about privacy at Inspire. Ensuring your safety remains our top priority, and we do numerous things to protect your information and your identity, and to provide you control.

Support: We have a 24/7 team of Community Managers who are here to support you and help you understand how to use Inspire. This is their full-time job. If you ever need help, don’t hesitate to reach out.

As always, we want you to continue to tell us what you think. Most of the features in Inspire are the result of your suggestions and ideas, which is the way things should be.

Thank you,

Gumby3939,https://www.inspire.com/m/Gumby3939/,"Long story short, I made the stupid decision to sleep with an escort on Saturday. In the beginning, maybe 5 minutes in, I pulled out and realized the condom broke. I was with a broken condom for maybe a minute or two. I put a new one on and finished. I also received unprotected oral. Following the next day, I started to notice an Icy Hot/burning like feeling on the top of my penis on the head and the tip. No discharge, no bumps, no discoloration, no pain, etc. When I pee, it also feels a little hot/burning but doesn't hurt. I contacted her and claimed she was clean. I met her down at the testing center where she got tested in front of me and are waiting for the results. She swears up and down she is clean and has never had sex without a condom and I was the first time she had a broken condom incident. She also said she gets tested regularly and was tested a month ago, but agreed to test in front of me to ease my mind. We should have those results by the end of the week. Today is the second day after, and I still have an icy hot/burning feeling. When I wake up, it feels fine. but once I get up and going, it'll slowly creep on me. It will also come and go throughout the day I've noticed. I'm afraid she may have given me an STD or STI. I'm more worried it could be something uncurable and have been freaking out since considering I'm only 21 and about to head off to college. I, of course, plan to get tested soon, but sucks I have to wait so long until testing can properly tell. Does this sound like anything to you guys?

oxolotltl,https://www.inspire.com/m/oxolotltl/,"Hello community!
I wanted to take the chance and share my story. Maybe someone can help me out here.

The beginning of my Story lies in the beginning of January, where I had unprotected intercourse with a woman in the Philippines.
We spent a week together, had a wealthier background and works for a Multinational. So no random street hookup.
Over the course of the week we had all kind of sexual practices, including oral and anal sex.

Well, I get home at the mid of January, and I got an eye infection (pink eye) together with burning in penis and pain in my genitals.
My doctor tested me on gonorrhea & chlamydia, both tests negative, but he was still quite convinced that it is chlamydia. So he prescribed me Doxycyclin, what I took for around 2 weeks. Symptoms gone, all fine. Out of my mind.

In March I had sex with another girl, and as she told me later on, she had some problems after we had sex.
This brought things back up for me again. And several weeks later some different symptoms started to come back up for me again.
I had again tests for all major STDs (HIV, Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Syphillis, Hepatitis), all negative.
Was in the hospital regarding another issue and had kind of an under the radar antibiotic injection, because the doctor thought it sounds like gonorrhea.
But all of this did not do the trick, and something is still not right.

My symptoms:
-Dry penis skin under foreskin, sometimes almost scaly
-itching tip of penis & sometimes slight pain
-some slight skin changes under foreskin (area of tiny white spots under my foreskin, had a slightly purple spot on the tip of my penis for a while)
-sensibility of penis
-pain in my epididyms/pain in the scrotum (I am not sure)
-itching anus

I went to a hospital with a specialized STD-centre.
The doctor looked at it and told me that it is a Mycose/fungal disease and gave me a creme, which I used for the prescribed 3 weeks, and it is still going on.
When I went back 2 weeks ago, they gave me Moxifloxacin antibiotics 400mg for 10 days, but my problems are still there.

So, this is my story.
As it seems, it is not really bacterial related. If so, I probably have by now produced some super resistant populations within me, with all the different kind of antibiotics handed out to me!

So, I would massively appreciate if someone could help me out!
I am quite hopeless these days.

All the best to all of you!","May 28, 2018 at 10:26 am",3 Replies,"About oxolotltl

Loverboy,https://www.inspire.com/m/Loverboy/,"A married woman with whom I have a FWB sexual relationship with for a year (always using condoms) informed me recently that a previous lover from over a year ago contacted her to tell her his wife was just diagnosed with condyloma...genital warts. He was sure he contracted it from the woman who is presently my lover, claiming he was only with her and he is sure his wife isnt cheating on him. From the situation (assuming what he claims is the truth) it seems clear my present lover is likely to be carrying the disease which means I too am probably carrying it as well as my wife(!?). She (lover) immediately went to get tested (visual and PAP smear). Her Md. reasured her she has no symptoms and nothing to worry about claiming the symtoms take 3 months to show up and since a year has passed with no signs , she is in the clear. I disscused the situation with my dermatologist who checked me visually and reassured me I have nothing to worry about. BUT I still don't have an answer to my question based on what I have read on the net. I understand one can carry the HPV virus without symtoms for 2 yrs or more. There is no true test to check if you are carrying the virus right? So couldnt the symtoms appear later than 3 months? Can I be sure my lover is not carrying the virus from previous encounters? Or if she is carrying it then I basically already am carrying it (probably my wife too?). So basically my question is, should I trust what both doctors are saying and continue worry free with my lover, or assume there is a huge risk by continuing to be intimate with my lover. Of course theres still the question where the previous lover's wife contracted it....unless of course she or her husband are dishonest and have been with others.......

Dear members,
I'm writing to share with you the latest in a series of patient-written “Experts by Experience” columns, as part of our collaboration with Mayo Clinic.

""Learning to Trust Again – My Journey with Drug Intolerance,"" is by Kelly Dubois, who was born with the inability to properly metabolize many medications due to certain mutated genes. Her column chronicles the challenges of finding clinicians who understood and could treat her safely and effectively. Her column is here: https://socialmedia.mayoclinic.org/2018/05/04/learning-to-trust-....

""After Surviving a Brain Tumor, I Made Time My Friend,"" by Claire Snyman, details how she manages the long-term complications of being a brain tumor survivor: https://socialmedia.mayoclinic.org/2018/04/20/after-surviving-a-.... ""Five years out from the day my life was saved, I continue to remind myself, that time is my friend,"" she wrote. ""I breathe in the small things, be my body’s own advocate and aim for balance.""

We invite you to comment on the two columns, and share them and other columns in the series widely.

You can learn more about twice-monthly ""Experts by Experience"" guest column series here: https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-inspir....

I had the result of anal PAP smear and it came back with no abnormal cells detected but I'm not really reassured as I know the smear is probably only about 70% accurate. My doctor recommends repeating in 3 years, although I expected him to say 2 years. I am thinking of finding another doctor to refer me for an HR anoscopy. All this is an addition to worry about HPV related throat cancer about which there is news of an epidemic in middle aged men almost every day. I am sure I am not the only middle aged man for whom worry about this has effectively taken over their life. I just feel that the axe of a cancer diagnosis could fall at any time. Is there ANY hope of curing or at least containing high risk HPV infections?","May 12, 2018 at 7:22 am",3 Replies,"About filmfan67

Brian,https://www.inspire.com/m/Brian/,"Dear members,

Today we are excited to announce that Inspire and Mayo Clinic have launched “Experts by Experience” – a series of columns written by patients and caregivers from around the world.

The kickoff column is Kindness at the Margins for Caregivers, by patient advocate Renata Louwers.

A main purpose of the series is to bring the patient perspective to people who can learn from these experiences. We hope that reading these stories will educate and inform about experiences through first-hand accounts, and paint a picture of the day in the life of a patient or caregiver.

We, along with Mayo Clinic, believe that through a deeper appreciation and understanding of patients’ perspectives, everyone involved in healthcare can learn and discover opportunities to improve quality and efficiency. in the belief that through a deeper appreciation and understanding of patients’ perspectives, everyone involved in healthcare can learn and discover opportunities to improve quality and efficiency.

The columns will appear monthly in communities here on Inspire.com, and on Mayo Clinic Social Media Network. We hope that you share the columns widely. You can learn more about the collaboration via this announcement by Mayo Clinic and Inspire.

If you have feedback on the series, please contact Inspire’s communications director, John Novack, via john@inspire.com.

Brian,https://www.inspire.com/m/Brian/,"Dear members,

In a few moments we will launch an exciting new feature for posts that we hope will make them even more useful and informative: tags.

Tags, as you have likely seen in other contexts like Twitter (they often appear with the ‘#’ hash symbol), help organize information into categories. They make it easier both to describe something and to search for it later.

Beginning today, you will see a collection of tags at the end of every post (it takes about 1-5 minutes for tags to appear on new posts). Tags are listed in order of most-relevant to least-relevant. You can click on any tag to view a list of other discussions and journals with that tag, and sort that list by relevance or date. This means you will see posts by Inspire members who may not be in one of your communities, but who might have written something that is very important to you.

For example, clicking on #PainManagement would show a list of relevant posts from the Chronic Pain community but also potentially useful posts in cancer, autoimmune diseases, arthritis, and other communities where pain management is an important topic.

You can search for relevant tags at https://www.inspire.com/tag.

You can also remove a tag from any post or comment you wrote by clicking the pencil icon next to the tag list. While the tagging system is highly accurate, it's not perfect, so we designed it to give you control over the tags for what you've written.

For now, only discussions and journals are searchable, but we know the comment sections can be a rich source of information too, so the ability to search for comments associated with tags is coming soon. We will continue to refine the tagging feature to make it better and give you even more control over how it can be used. In the future, you will be able to:

- Search for tags directly in the Inspire search engine
- Filter tags by community
- Create your own tags
- Subscribe to tags so they appear on your home page and in your emails from Inspire
- Find posts that contain two or more tags

We strive to make it as easy as possible for you to find the information and support you need, so as you explore this feature, please share your thoughts about it here or at team@inspire.com. We want to know what works, what doesn’t, and any other suggestions you may have for improvement. Thank you!

Together, we’re better.

I'm worried I may possibly get HPV from my brother's girlfriend or from my brother from indirect contact (touching same surfaces, using the same hand towel, sweat, from coughing, sneezing, etc). I guess I have a few questions:

1. How likely is it for me to get HPV through indirect or direct, nonsexual contact (shaking hands, sweat, etc)?

2. If I were to get HPV through my brother/brother's girlfriend is the HPV I get immediately cancerous? If not, how likely is it that it becomes cancerous?

3. If HPV is dormant, is it still possible to get it from someone, or does the HPV need to be active?

4. How careful do I need to be around those who actively have HPV?

Sorry for the lengthy post, but just worried about how I may get HPV and be transmitting something horrible to my girlfriend.","April 30, 2018 at 3:05 pm",4 Replies,"About o0o

Fredo101,https://www.inspire.com/m/Fredo101/,"Each April ASHA recognizes STD Awareness Month. Visit our #STDMonth18 page for free downloads and more: http://www.ashasexualhealth.org/sexually-transmitted-diseases-aw....

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):

• There are 20 million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases (also referred to as sexually transmitted infections) in the U.S. every year
• The medical costs for these new cases are $16 billion
• Adding the new cases each year with existing infection, there are an estimated 110 million total STDs among Americans.

People may not know they have an STD because many do not have symptoms, and they can cause serious health consequences if they are not detected and treated appropriately. For example, chlamydia left untreated can put a woman at risk for pelvic inflammatory disease, a condition that can lead to infertility. To spread the message about the importance of STD testing ASHA is continuing the “YES Means TEST™” initiative to educate and empower young adults who say “YES” to sexual activity also to say “YES” to getting tested for STDs.

STD testing can be confidential and free or low-cost, and common STDs, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, are usually effectively treated with antibiotics. For more information about STDs, “YES Means TEST” or how and where to get tested, visit www.yesmeanstest.org.

6 months ago i had an encounter with a cheap sex worker.
We engage to protected sexual intercourse and unprotected oral(blow job and cunnilingus) note that on the cunnilingus part i only use my lower lip to stimulate her for a few minutes.
Fast forward to october i developed an eye stye on the same month i saw a white lump on my testicle thought it was hpv but the doc said it is just a whitehead. Fast forward to november. I saw some pimple like dots on my body i searched the internet and saw it is a sign of hiv. (Which i know is a wrong thing to do). These following months seems like my skin is discoloring there are this white like spots under it i also see red spots on my skin and today as i was taking a bath i noticed that there is a red purplish rash like stretchmark on my groin left side of my genitals. It is hard to get tested here in our country and i am the breadwinner of our family i think i have let them down by doing this stupid thing. I think i have hiv.

magicdog8893,https://www.inspire.com/m/magicdog8893/,"Hi, this isnt the easiest topic to reach out about, but it is something that is affecting me mentally very much. I feel that I have issues involving premature ejaculation. I know this is considered a type of erectile dysfunction, but when I search that out, most of the information pertains to men who cannot gain an erection. I have no issue becoming erect. BUT, I do not believe I have been sexually satisfying to my partners. I feel like I have never learned how to control the release. I know it should be within someone's mental control, but I become so excited during sex that I ejaculate very quickly. Thinking about it last night, I was making the analogy to myself that maybe its like a child becoming potty trained...something that has to become learned and then isnt thought about much thereafter. I am 40 years old and have been married for 10 years. We are now getting divorced but for other reasons. My wife and I have not been intimate for more than a handful of times over the last two years while going through this process.

Dear members,
I'm writing to share with you the second in a series of “Experts by Experience” columns, as part of a collaboration between Inspire and Mayo Clinic.

We invite you to read ""Multiple Sclerosis, Illusions, and 'Working Understandings,'"" by Gil Greenman.

In his column, Mr. Greenman, who has secondary progressive MS, wrote, ""People like me often live in a world of denial and illusions. We sometimes call them 'working understandings.' They are based on some facts, some experience, and more often hope. Some serve us for years and drive many good decisions.""

The first column in the Mayo/Inspire series was ""Kindness at the Margins for Caregivers,"" by patient advocate Renata Louwers.

We invite you to comment on Mr. Greenman's column, and share it and other columns in the series widely.

1) after less than 1 and half week after exposure, my body started to itch in the inside and i had a big pimple on my left leg under knee and it hurts until it exploded to a green liquid. also three small ones on my mousatche area leaving a dark spots until now after they healed.
2) the second week, i noticed my stomach started to rumble, made noisy sounds even if i'm full or hungry took like 3 weeks to stop. plus, i started to develop petechiae, on my palms. one time i saw something like fighting under my palm skin like blood on one small region leaving a little pain and a 3 or 4 red spots on the region.
3) at the same time, my left leg vastus medialis muscle started to twitch, until now, but it stops sometimes and it starts to twitch again and i started to hear waving in my both ears ( Tinnitus)) i was so worried, you can't imagine.
4) the sixth week or sooner, the head of my penis start to hurt and itch with a sticky liquid under the head, leaving dark 5 dots on the head after it stopped until now they still, and i remember i felt pain in my right testicle for minutes.
5) the ninth week it was raining and cold outside, i went out then i came home and i developed a flu, fever, i took Advil and fever went right away, but the coughing didn't go, i cough white phlegm, normally i used to cough white phlegm, then green, then it stops, but now it's just white. if i remember this week of flu, i started to have skin issues, especially on my legs, it burns a little, and feels sticky, leaving a bad smell on my cloths and bed, plus i felt pain on left, up, my back.
6) the same week the 68th day after exposure, on my way for the tests, i had pain under my feet and in the articulation of my feet, i went to get tested for Syphilis, Hep A, B,C and HIV all results turned out Negative.
7) yesterday i woke up, and i noticed a circle 1,5 mm red spot on my noise, appear and disappear after i pass my finger on it like a petichiae it doesn't hurt. i took a hot shower, i saw my face on the mirror then i saw red spots on forehead and noise.
8) yesterday, i saw an article online about thrush, i checked it out, i found out that i have little thrush next my
throat.
just to be honest, it was my first time to do such a mistake, like I'm not the kind who play around like i did, it was once, and unprotected. also i know that it needs 84 days to get tested for good results, i'm willing to go and get tested Wednesday, i just i want to know what's happening to me, is there anyone of you who had the same symptoms or close, what STD it could be? please help me i'm so worried.","January 23, 2018 at 4:04 pm",2 Replies,"About Wednesdate

Brian,https://www.inspire.com/m/Brian/,"Dear members,

Last night, Inspire hit a milestone -- one million members.

One thing that is clearer than ever is that the value of this community is created by you, every minute of every day. I often think that our job is to provide you a safe, supportive space, and then get out of your way. The words you write and the friendships you forge are things we could never create on our own.

We began this company ten years ago with a passionate belief that the conversations patients have with one another are just as important as the conversations they have with doctors and the rest of the traditional medical establishment.

We decided early on to try to partner with the best patient advocacy organizations. I remember how incredible it was to watch new members join WomenHeart, National Osteoporosis Foundation, and Ovarian Cancer -- some of our earliest communities -- and begin sharing their stories. It was clear right away that all of us, as patients and caregivers and families and friends need to find others having experiences like our own.

We barely anticipated just how strong this drive to find others like ourselves would be. I spoke with one early member who joined Inspire with his real name rather than a nickname. I explained to him that he might not remain anonymous if he used his real name, but he interrupted and told me that he had a terminal cancer diagnosis. “I want anyone who is looking for me to be able to find me,” he told me.

It has been especially gratifying to see connections, forged in over nine million discussions and over 1.5 billion words, turn into face-to-face meetings. Members have organized events like the annual North Carolina Bladder Cancer Awareness Picnic and the annual Inspire gatherings at the Ovarian Cancer National Conference.

More recently, Inspire’s rare disease communities have been a great example of strength in numbers. One quarter of Inspire members are affected by a rare or ultra-rare disease. Many members who never met someone else with their rare condition did so for the first time on Inspire. The information these members share is not only valuable to others with their condition, it could lead to insights that accelerate medical progress -- one of our primary goals.

As far as we have come, there is still work yet to do. We will continue to build ways for you to find what you are looking for, and we continue to think about how to make Inspire the best it can be for each of you.

Ten years and a million members later, I am still struck by the vivid, authentic, heartfelt stories you share, and the value you bring to one another. Thank you for creating this community.

Together, we’re better.

Brian,https://www.inspire.com/m/Brian/,"Dear members,

I often think about the Inspire community in its entirety. Our collective knowledge of illness, health, and the many pathways between them is expansive and varied.

However, I suspect the experience for most of you is more particular, as you settle into one or a few communities that are most important to you.

The connections we create with one another in our small groups can run deep and lead to wonderful things, like the women with a rare heart disease who connected in Inspire’s WomenHeart community and banded together to initiate a research effort at the Mayo Clinic. Or the man who cultivated a rich support network for himself and others over many years in the Lung Cancer Survivors community.

But our shared community has so much helpful information that inevitably some of us won’t discover some of the many useful posts.

So, I’d love to know, and I think others would too: what are your favorite posts on Inspire, ones that you return to and re-read?

Maybe it’s a useful bit of information about a treatment. Maybe it’s some good advice or a few encouraging words. Maybe someone told a story that stuck with you. Maybe it’s an illuminating, long-running conversation that you check in on or participate in. Or perhaps it’s not a single post but a person whose writing you follow.

I invite you to leave a link to your favorite post (or poster) in a comment below, and please describe why you return to it. Thank you!

I don't want to give it to anyone, and the guy I was seeing stopped talking to me after I told him I have it. I don't know whether to be abstinent for the next year until I get another PAP to test for it again or what. Because I read that condoms still can't protect 100% against HPV. I have depression and anxiety as well so it's just made me feel awful and I'm not dealing with it very well. I just need some support and advice.

Have not had sex yet but the recovery of the wart is taking a while and she is pressuring me for sex....Trying to play it off...Should I tell her or not???Heres my options...
Option one
Just tell her that I can't see her right now I've got too much going on. Leave it at that.
That way the door is open in the future.

Option two
Tell her about my problem. Risk that she might totally abandon me and be done with me forever.

Option three.
Don't tell her and roll the dice. She more than likely will find out since she's a Registered nurse.

Option four
Go to the doctor and get a treatment.
Explain to her that you had a boil burned off

I had been to the toilet myself, shortly before, and the worst part is I don't remember washing my hands - she was crying and I was flustered. I dipped the suppository in water before applying it. She had been saying the poop was ready to come out but it was hurting her butt too much, so I take that to mean there could even have been some tearing inside her anus, from the extremely little I know about these things. The crying got worse while waiting for the suppository to take effect, and she said it was stinging.

I haven't had any symptoms myself, so I was shocked when I got the results, but then I remembered my partner had some weird thing on the corner of his mouth a couple of weeks back.

Chronic-Inspire,https://www.inspire.com/m/Chronic-Inspire/,"The FDA's Patient Engagement Advisory Committee held their first meeting last week.

By Radha_Inspire
Digital Editor, Inspire

Early and consistent patient involvement along the spectrum of the clinical trials process – especially during the initial design stage – was the common refrain heard during last week’s inaugural public meeting of the FDA’s Patient Engagement Advisory Committee (PEAK).

Members of the 12-person committee met to hear from representatives of government agencies, industry, academia, non-profit groups, patient advocacy groups, and patients themselves. The meeting, held in Gaithersburg, Maryland, was open to the public.

“We understand the journey of the patient and the desire for people to improve their lives… especially [for] those who come after them who may be afflicted by the same type of condition or disease,” said committee chair Paul Conway, president of the American Association of Kidney patients, of his fellow members, all of whom have first-hand experience as patients themselves or as caregivers. “That’s what the basis of our thinking is.”

PEAC is part of an FDA-wide effort to integrate the patient voice into regulatory processes. The committee’s purpose last week was to understand how patient perspectives can be integrated into medical device regulation and use, particularly in developing and implementing clinical trials for such devices, but the topics discussed over the two-day meeting ranged wide and included the value of patient experience, safety and data privacy, communication, diversity, and dignity.

Among the points brought up regarding earlier and more patient involvement in clinical trial design in general were that such involvement would ensure that trials would be designed with outcomes that matter to patients and not just researchers. Patient inputs would also aid trial design to make participation easy and attractive.

The likelihood that any policies based on outcomes from such trials are beneficial to affected people would be higher, all agreed, and patient voices should be involved in these stages as well.

While patient involvement is a high priority across fields, organizations have lacked a clear, codified way to involve patients.

“Quite frankly the opportunities for patients to engage are very, very limited,” said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, citing limited time to speak during public meetings or single patient representatives on advisory committees. “The world has changed for how we should be communicating with people.”

Ken Getz, founder of the Center for Information and Study of Clinical Research Participation, said that while more organizations are piloting or considering patient engagement initiatives, “we have an environment where there is an absence of clarity in terms of policy and regulatory acceptance or direction [for them],” which keeps such programs from becoming widespread.


Facilitators lead small group discussions to strategize the most effective ways to bring the patient voice into the clinical trials process.

A portion of the first meeting day was devoted to roundtable discussions with those in the room about a hypothetical weight-loss device that needed to go through clinical trials and regulatory approval. FDA facilitators asked people to consider how to find, recruit, and involve patients over the entirety of the process, what challenges might arise, how to overcome them, and how to make sure all involved parties felt safe, valued, and respected. The PEAC received summaries of table discussions and could ask clarification questions before later consideration.

The discussions centered largely around upstream issues such as how and where to identify appropriate patient populations for specific clinical trials, successful recruitment strategies, how to communicate the basics of what a clinical trial is and what the goals of a particular study are to a general audience, how to minimize the challenges patients face in participating in clinical trials, and how to earn and maintain trust before, during, and after trial participation. Again, discussants cited patients themselves as the best resource for tackling these challenges.

Part of the second day was dedicated to formal comments from patients to the PEAC. One speaker, Linda Radich, a patient advocate who had six hip replacement surgeries, spoke forcefully about the value of the patient perspective, giving further weight to earlier discussions.

“Our stories of harm have the deepest and most profound lessons from which industry and the FDA can learn,” she said. “Patients provide the single most powerful source of real world evidence. We can tell you what is an acceptable risk tolerance… we can tell you what’s important to us in the devices we receive or what we would like in a trial, what works and what doesn’t.”

The meeting concluded with final thoughts and further issues for the PEAC to consider. These included better processes for reporting adverse events, personal data safety, and more attention to diverse patient populations and rare disease patient populations.

PEAC member Suzanne Schrandt, director of Patient Engagement at the Arthritis Foundation, made a last proposal.

“Let’s get t-shirts made that say ‘ask the patients’ because I think that’s so crucial.”

Watch the webcast of the meeting here. The public may contact PEAC to ask questions or make comments or suggestions with the contact information available here.

applesoranges,https://www.inspire.com/m/applesoranges/,"I'm in horrible pain! I have a shooting pain down my the left side of my neck, into my shoulder and shoulder blade and down my arm into my hand. I already had an x-ray and waiting on insurance to approve MRI. In the meantime, I'm taking flexerill and oxycodone 5mg. I still feel the sever spasms in my my arm and shoulder. I've had two kids and this is up there with labor contractions. Even with the meds I feel them. I can't sleep more than three hours at a time, I wake up in agony no matter how or what position I sleep in. I just need a hug. Its so painful friggen PAINFUL! I have an 8yo son so I can't take oxy during the day, so I'm incomplete agony in the mornings. I don't know how much more I can take, this has been going on for a month now, the severe pain, but now that I think about the past couple of years I've had a nagging neck pain and sometimes shoulder pain. I've had a hard time wearing a bra too. I have degenerative disc disease among other issues with my spine. Please just think good thoughts and send some good energy this way. I wouldn't wish this on anyone.

Update, four days later and still in f*cking agony. I can't bear it any longer!! Calling the doctors office Monday morning. I'm not sleeping more than a few hours at a time, I have to keep taking the meds to get anything done. The shooting pain down my arm and the muscle spasms are unreal! Hurts SOSOSOSOSOSOOOOO much It makes my cry. The side of my neck is so swollen, never mind my upper back. Ice packs are my friend.

Update #2: I forgot to mention that last Monday early morning I wound up going to the ER the pain was so bad. They gave me a shot of Prednisone, and a script for prednisone20mg (for two weeks) and gabapentin 100mg. It does help me function but still feeling pain and limited motion but it helps get me through without that gawd awful oxycodone, which I stopped taking the day before the ER visit, it makes me so sick to my stomach and it did nothing for the pain. Vomiting and extreme neck, back, shoulder pain all at the same time! Good times!

OddBall96,https://www.inspire.com/m/OddBall96/,"Hey guys, I'm new to the Herpes community, never thought I would find myself here but I bet you guys didn't either.

Before I ask my questions, let me give you a little back story...

Last weekend I spent with my boyfriend, we were sexually active and always use protection, he also performed oral sex (just incase this helps...). Fast forward to Tuesday, I started getting some itching and discomfort in my lady area (not fun), I started to treat it as if it was a UTI and possibly thrush. Wednesday I woke up feeling a little bleh but felt better throughout the day. Towards the end of the day, I started feeling a little more uncomfortable, a lot more irritated. I just ignored it and I went to work. At work, I noticed that I was becoming really uncomfortable, to the point where I was feeling ill and wanted to go home. I still thought it was a bad UTI so I whipped out the cranberry juice and started to feel better within an hour.

Thursday was pretty much the same as Wednesday night, very uncomfortable and feeling a little ill. I couldn't remember if it was Wednesday or Thursday night but I remember waking up scratching myself in my sleep and then feeling a crazy pain, as if I had just cut myself. I ignored it and went back to sleep.

Friday, I bought thrush medication and continued to google symptoms (bad f&#*ing idea). I continued to treat myself as I wasn't able to get in to see the doctors for over a week. Saturday I had work and afterwards went back to my boyfriends place and got him to have a look. I was very scared, I feared the worst... He found some sores and told me he thinks its genital herpes. I lost it, I began having a panic attack and he bundled me up and took me to the hospital. On the way there, he did mention that he had a coldsore about 15 years ago and that his ex girlfriend refused to get tested for anything (they didn't use protection). My partner hasn't had any symptoms and was really surprised that I had developed this outbreak.

The doctor checked me and took a swab, he said that it does look like herpes but the test will help confirm it so that I can treat it in the future before the outbreak happens.

I may have contracted it from a partner in the past and it may have been laying dormant in my system all this time but I have been subjected to a lot this year (stress, illness etc.) and have not had an outbreak until the other day. My partner is going to get tested later this week and I'm going to try and get in to see my doctor this week as well. I'm still coming to terms with the diagnosis but it is what it is. I'm on anti-vitals at the moment but the hardest part of this is definitely the mental and emotional toll it has taken on me. My partner, whether he shared or not, has been wonderful, he has been researching constantly so he can answer all of my questions (which there are a lot of!).

ANYWAY!

I have a few questions that I'll keep short...

*Can I go swimming/to the gym during an outbreak?
*What can I do to take extra precaution when protecting my partner?
*Relieving pain and irritation during?
*What is something I can do if I am HSV2 and my partner is HSV1?
*Any advice in general would also be great!

Healthy_C,https://www.inspire.com/m/Healthy_C/,"I had oral sex with the man I am seeing, twice and after three days of the second time we did it I came down with a crazy fever (39 degrees and higher), sore throat severe headache and some bumps on my vulva. Oh and yes at first it hurt when I tried to urinate. I had recovered from a stomach flu the week before and thought this was odd. (I only get fevers once or twice a year)

I got really scared and went to see a doctor and he said I have a throat infection and the bumps are molluscum contagium which is an sti but common in kids. He told me to drink a lot of water and take panadol...

After that I have done a lot of googling and I can’t help but think it is herpes as the symptoms match up. I have burned the bumps with apple cider vinegar and treated it with tea tree oil and am taking vitamins at the moment with a towel on head trying to cool down my fever. I have even asked the dreaded question to the man I am seeing in a polite way asking if “he has had any issues in that area before” but he surprisedly said “no!”

applesoranges,https://www.inspire.com/m/applesoranges/,"Hi Gang,

So I'm having a herniated disc removed on November 8th (C4-C5) and I'm scared to death! I've had surgeries before so I know what to expect but I'm still super nervous and dreading the awful scar I'll have on my neck. I know I REALLY need this surgery, I'm in pain day in and day out. I'm on an extremely high dose of Gabapentin, and I still feel pain and burning and my arm is weak from tolerating the pain for so long. I don't do well with anesthesia or morphine so I will apologize to the staff before I go into surgery because gawd knows what will come out of my mouth. I almost don't want to go through with it, but this is the only way to get some relief. I've drained all other options and I'm super tired of all of this. I just want it to be done and over with. Any and all advice is needed!

JohnNovack,https://www.inspire.com/m/JohnNovack/,"Dear members,
This past weekend, an Inspire researcher and a member of our Advanced Breast Cancer Support Community participated in a panel discussion at the Medicine X conference at Stanford University. The main stage session at the international conference examined how people with cancer choose US hospitals for their cancer surgery, and to help improve how patients choose hospitals for cancer care.

The ""Collaboration in Cancer Care"" conference session stemmed from a collaboration by cancer treatment and research institution Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK), the national media outlet ProPublica, and Inspire, and was founded on a survey of nearly 4,000 Inspire members affected by cancer. Inspire's Dave Taylor discussed implications of the survey findings, and talking about her personal experience in selecting surgery for her cancer was Tonya Bellati, a 10-year survivor of advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer, and an Inspire member.

While there has been considerable focus finding new cures for cancer, particularly fueled by the national Cancer Moonshot Initiative, session organizers noted that no similar unified effort is being dedicated to providing the best possible care for patients with cancer. All the panelists agreed that direct involvement by patients and caregivers must be part of any such effort.

You can learn more about the Inspire-aided research in this news article by Stanford Medicine. We invite you to share the article, and comment on it here if you have undergone surgery for cancer, or if you're considering it now.

Finally, we thank all those Inspire members who took the time to share their insights with us through the survey. We're grateful to you, as you have collectively helped generate an important conversation. We hope the Stanford panel discussion will spark further research, so that patients will have better and clearer pathways to choose their treatment options.

Fredo101,https://www.inspire.com/m/Fredo101/,"The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has published a draft of its updated guidelines for cervical cancer screening. The draft guidelines and supporting evidence is available on the USPSTF site at https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/us-preve...

The proposed guidelines continue to call for screening women ages 21-29 with Pap every three years. Women older than 65 with an adequately negative screening history end screening stops after age 65. This is consistent with current guidelines.

However, a significant change is recommend for women ages 30-65 at normal risk. The draft calls for screening with either a Pap test every three years or an HPV test every five years. Pap/HPV co-testing is not included in the recommendation.

The draft guidelines may be altered given feedback USPSTF receives during the commentary period, especially from professional organizations like American College of Obstetricans and Gynocologist and the American Cancer Society.

Chronic-Inspire,https://www.inspire.com/m/Chronic-Inspire/,"By Radha_Inspire
Digital Editor, Inspire

In 2010, researchers from Stanford University discovered that love – in particular, that initial phase of intense romantic infatuation – acted on the brain much like a strong painkiller, triggering the same areas associated with wellbeing and reward.

Though it was a small study of 15 men and women, the work underscores a body of research that shows how supportive partnerships can have both emotional and physical benefits with respect to pain.

However, even attempting to date in order to get to that infatuation stage of a relationship can be a challenge for people with chronic conditions and chronic pain.

Some issues that can put the kibosh on dating include low self esteem, poor body image, fear of stigma, and the physical toll of chronic pain.

“There are times you're just not able to do what your healthier peers are doing. Saying, 'I can't go out tonight because I just want to rest – it's hard for people to understand that if you were fine the day before or even a few hours before,"" said Ashley Boynes-Shuck, a Pittsburgh, PA-based author, health coach and advocate who has osteoarthritis and chronic migraines, in a recent article in U.S. News.

Having secured a date or several, the next big issue is disclosure – when is the best time to let someone you’re dating know about your condition and how chronic pain affects your life?

A 2013 piece in The Atlantic exploring this question turned up no specific answers. All the patients featured in the story were blindly trying to strike the balance between disclosing too early and risking scaring their dates and disclosing too late, which might compromise trust. In addition, dating someone with a painful chronic condition means accepting the emotional and physical toll it takes, and sometimes neither party is up to that challenge.

But these issues don’t have to be non-starters for people who have chronic conditions or chronic pain. In the U.S. News story, pain experts and patients offered four pieces of advice:

1. Know your worth - chronic illness is just one part of who you are, and it’s not a bad part either.
2. Communicate continuously – to help others understand both your pain and your needs.
3. Be understanding – because it’s hard to watch someone be chronically ill and in pain.
4. Seek connection – beyond romantic partners, support from friends, family, online communities, healthcare teams, and others is critical.

Read the full U.S. News story here.

Cadillac46,https://www.inspire.com/m/Cadillac46/,"Hello all,

About 11 weeks ago I received unprotected oral sex from a female of unknown status (I am male). About two weeks after I noticed a small red patch on the side of my penis which to me looked like rug burn. I went to an urgent care and he said it did not look like herpes and it healed in about 2-3 days. Other than that I have not had any lesions or sores. I have had a slight pain in my lower left pelvic/groin region but cannot feel any lymph nodes so thinking maybe it is workout related. I reached out to the female and she said she doesn't have any sores in her mouth or anything but I know there can sometimes be transmission with no symptoms. All in all I have a lot of anxiety with this exposure and not sure what to do:

1. Are these symptoms typical of herpes? And how risky was my exposure?
2. Do you recommend testing without sores? And if so should I test for both HSV 1 and HSV 2? I am nervous for a false positive
3. I have read HSV 1 genital from oral is far less likely to show no symptoms, is this true?

I really appreciate the time and help.","September 11, 2017 at 7:53 pm",2 Replies,"About Cadillac46

The search box at the top of the page (the magnifying glass if you are on mobile) will allow you to search across All Communities by default, or narrow it down to a single community that you belong to. But it’s on the search results page itself that the new search engine really shines.

You’ll find as you use the search engine that the results that you are looking for are far more relevant. Our Engineering team has done a great deal of work tuning these results to make sure that the posts you find are what matters to you.

But now there’s much more than just Posts. We also show you a handful of Communities and Conditions that match your query as well. And you’ll notice that there are separate tabs at the top where you can see the full list of Communities and Conditions that match your search. This way we can direct you to the places that might have even more valuable information for you. You’ll probably notice as well our brand new Conditions pages, which will soon also contain posts for each condition!

We hope you enjoy this new search engine and find it much more relevant to your needs. In the coming months there will be more tabs appearing on this search results page, including treatments, medications, and other items of interest. Your feedback is always welcome!

I tested positive for Genital herpes April 18th , the genital culture does not distinguish between type 1 or 2 but my IgG test was positive for type 1 . My NP Said if I outbreak within 3-4 months then it's a new hsv2 infection . Well , I decided to get another IgG test , this was done June 6th - I tested positive for type 1 and negative for type 2. I haven't had any outbreaks since the initial outbreak (well i don't think I have). I figured I had type 2 because of the location of the lesions but I read different things online so it's a bit confusing.

Justme73,https://www.inspire.com/m/Justme73/,I was initially diagnosed with hsv 8 yrs ago with the usually horrible initial outbreak along with a yeast infection and BV. They continued for several months to a year every month along with a yeast infection. Then finally seemed to subside. Well about 2 weeks ago I got a year infection and went to the doctor knowing I had a yeast infection and found I had a BV as well. A few days later the symptoms of another outbreak stated to show. I figured they would be mild and pass quickly. They are not. This is feeling almost as strong as the initial. Has anyone else had a bad outbreak years later? Could there be a chance it's another contraction of the alternate hsv? I'm not feeling sick with the flu symptoms that I have with past outbreaks.

TeacherCeleste,https://www.inspire.com/m/TeacherCeleste/,"Hello everyone,

The end of May I went to the gyno for a routine screening and also to acquire about symptoms of itching that I had 2 weeks after having unprotected sex with a guy friend that happens to be be in a relationship(Please do not judge me). The dr suspected BV and gave me Flagyl to take for 7 days 2 times a day. I then called about 4 days later for the labs and my swab showed a few trichmoniases( I think I am spelling it right). When I got my diagnosis, I was so depressed and down. I did not eat for a week and took days off from work. As I was just getting over my diagnosis, I started having symptoms of stomach cramps as if my period was about to start and itchiness and slight burning. All of these symptoms were off and on through out the day. They basically would start and stop I decided to call my gyno and she told to come in for a second swab. When I was in the room she told me that she's going to swab me for infections that could have came with the trichmoniasis. I asked her what other infections could have came with trich and that is when she discussed Mycoplasma and Urelplasma!. I have no knowledge about any of those STIs. When she did the swab and looked at my cervix she said she saw a little discharge but not much to be alarmed by. She prescribed me Flagyl and Azithromycin to take all at once. Immediately after taking the medicine the symptoms left, but the stomach cramping started back the next day. Being so worried about my health, I did not take into consideration that these stomach cramps and discharge was a sign of an upcoming period. The same day the cramps started my period started. I am still on my period and the cramps and the stomach ache has gone away, but I still have a burn that just comes and goes through out the day and I am suspecting that this particular symptom is a yeast infection from the antibiotics that I consumed during my first and second visit and the stomach cramps was PMS symptoms. I will not receive my labs from this swab until Thursday and I am dying over anticipation.

I researched that Trich can also lead to Mycoplasma or urelplasma. I remember my guy friend saying that it was hard for him to ejaculate with his girlfriend and I am now thinking he could have had NGU that developed from trich being left untreated for some time. He has been tested for all STDS except for Mycoplasma and Urelplasma. But then again, during sex with me he did ejaculate very quickly with no problem. I did at the time notice yellowish tinted sperm, but I did not think nothing of it. I am so disappointed because I have known him for a year and trusted him.

Also what does Metro and Azithromycin cure when taken together? Could the gyno gave me both pills just to be on the safe side in case I still had trich or have Mycoplasma? Is mycoplasma curable? Am I able to have kids","July 3, 2017 at 12:43 pm",3 Replies,"About TeacherCeleste

Radha_Inspire,https://www.inspire.com/m/Radha_Inspire/,"Dear members,

Inspire has just released a new online report, Experts by Experience 2017, a compilation of a year's worth of monthly columns written by patients and caregivers for the Stanford Medicine ""Scope"" blog. Inspire and Stanford Medicine have partnered on the patient-written columns for more than five years, and this is the fifth edition of ""Experts.""



The phrase ""experts by experience,"" which resonates clearly here at Inspire, came from a Stanford/Inspire column by patient advocate Andy Jablonski, founder of the Short Bowel Syndrome Foundation, an Inspire partner.

The essays speak eloquently about the extreme human experience of living with chronic, debilitating illness including coming to grips with a chronic illness and then moving forward, ignorance and cruelty, the current state of medical practice, and the vital importance of social support. But even beyond these stories, there is so much more to learn.

We invite you to read the compilation and share it widely.

JohnNovack,https://www.inspire.com/m/JohnNovack/,"Dear members,

Like many, we’ve been watching the phenomenon of the Pokemon Go app, and not only many of our employees and friends are actively catching Pokemon, but several Inspire members have recently shared their experiences about how this has positively impacted their health.

The game, as I suspect many of you know, allows players to use their mobile devices to explore real-world locations for finding Pokemon and capture them. Alternatively, players can collect Pokemon by “incubating” eggs by walking for a specific distance. One recent article described Pokemon as a “gamified pedometer.”

We’re noticing that it’s not just young people playing the game just for the sake of playing a game. One Inspire member, in fact, a 59-year-old woman with lung cancer and COPD, has started a discussion that described how Pokemon Go “has me up, outside & walking.” Read about it here.

Are you playing Pokemon Go? If so, we’d love to hear how this game has affected you. What types of Pokemon have you caught? Any rare ones for which you’re able to share the map location?

Please note that this is not a commercial message and we’re not endorsing Pokemon Go or its business affiliates. We're certainly following the safety-related stories about Pokemon Go. All that said, we're excited about this phenomenon and are interested in understanding how this game, and games like it, can help members of Inspire to improve their health and cope with their diseases.

Whatnow3,https://www.inspire.com/m/Whatnow3/,"In January I found out I had HSV-2 despite never having any symptoms and always being ""safe"" with previous partners. Last year I found out my then-boyfriend had been cheating, but I had postponed the std check until recently because I had been having a variety of other health problems and going to the gyno was just not a priority.

I've been stressing out about my diagnosis ever since the doctor told me and became paranoid that every lump and bump is an outbreak blister. Yesterday my lower abdomen began to hurt, and I felt like I had to pee constantly but almost nothing came out, and it hurt when it did. I also noticed a ""zit"" on my butt and also down there. All these symptoms combined got me freaking out, so I went to the doctor and she confirmed that I'm having an outbreak. She prescribed me valtrex and an ointment and even though I just started it today I feel like it's helping but it's too soon to tell.

Now I have all these questions that I forgot to ask when I was there. Can I still use tampons when I have outbreaks? What about hair removal? Shaving? Waxing? Can I exercise? I feel like sweat and friction won't help this whole situation.

I feel so gross and disgusted with myself. My boyfriend (of about 9 months) is pretty accepting of it, but hinted that he thinks it's weird that it just suddenly showed up. I told him I've been faithful to him (because I have) but I feel like this might hurt our relationship if he can't trust me. Then on the other hand how can I be sure I didn't catch it from him?! I don't want to be paranoid but I feel like this is a huge deal.","February 17, 2017 at 6:03 pm",3 Replies,"About Whatnow3

Fredo101,https://www.inspire.com/m/Fredo101/,"CNN and other outlets have run articles on a recently published paper linking high levels of antibody to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2, the main cause of genital herpes) in pregnant women with an increased risk their baby will later be found to have autism. The authors of the paper believe the potential link isn’t that the virus interacts directly with the fetus, but could be due to an inflammatory response HSV2 causes in the mother that may ultimately interfere with the development of the baby’s nervous system.

The response to these findings has been mixed with several leading experts (including ASHA’s medical and scientific advisors) believing many unanswered questions remain and agreeing that much more research would be needed to validate these results.

“Women who have HSV2 and who are pregnant, or planning pregnancy, should not be alarmed by this study” says Anna Wald, MD, MPH of the University of Washington. “While we need to continue to investigate the reasons for autism, I am not convinced by this study that there is a link between antibody levels to HSV in mid-pregnancy and the risk of autism.”

Bottom line: most pregnant women with HSV2 have normal pregnancies and deliver healthy babies. Many HSV researchers and clinical experts aren’t overly concerned by these findings and don’t think women should be, either. As always, talk to your health care provider if you have questions. You can read more about herpes and pregnancy from the University of Washington Virology Research Clinic and also ASHA’s Herpes Resource Center.

YaaasKhaleesi,https://www.inspire.com/m/YaaasKhaleesi/,"Yesterday I was diagnosed with Genital Herpes (and a UTI, just to make things extra fun). I feel devastated. Being a feminist and sexual assault survivor, I'm not one to prescribe to the virgin/whore dichotomy. But I can't help but feel the weight of the social stigma crushing me. Sex has always been an incredibly complicated thing for me, personally, having been molested and assaulted more than once. I had actually never had sex before until a little over a year ago, with a partner who I later left once he became abusive. I worked so hard to reclaim that part of me. PTSD doesn't make it easy. Now this has happened, and I feel robbed of my sexuality once again. It was already so hard, and now I also have to contend with this. I feel like no one will ever love me romantically. I feel like no one will want to be with me sexually. I feel alone. I feel like I'll never be in control of that part of myself. Please, please tell me it gets better. I'm struggling to imagine ever feeling okay. I've been thinking about suicide.

I'm writing to share with you a recent story about Inspire. We were honored to be described in this manner and particularly grateful to members Renata Louwers and Mike Lawing for their insights. Please share the article as you see fit.

Also, Inspire employees gathered at our Arlington, VA office last week for a company retreat.

Aba26,https://www.inspire.com/m/Aba26/,"Hey everyone! So I've posted on here a few times before, but I wanted to share my story regarding HPV and questions that concern me.

I was diagnosed with HPV warts in 2007-2008 due to the obvious symptoms. During that time I also recieved the vaccine to help prevent further infection of other types. It took about 1-1.5 years to initially ""clear"" the virus, meaning I had no more symptoms. Fast forward to 2011-2012, my Papsmear came back normal. 2013, also normal. 2016, normal. I've only had that one outbreak during the time of diagnosis and never experienced another since.

Anyways, ive been married for 7 years, up until last year(2016). I'm currently with a new partner. What is your thoughts and opinions on disclosure of my past HPV infection and what are my chances of passing it on to him after so many years of being ""cleared? Any information would be so much appreciated :)","February 4, 2017 at 12:35 am",2 Replies,"About Aba26

Aramat13,https://www.inspire.com/m/Aramat13/,"I acquired genital HSV-1 from a partner that had cold sores on his mouth. There seems to be less information on this type of herpes. I've heard that transmission rates are lower because the virus is not in its ""preferred"" site. Is there any data on this that I could give to potential partners?

I have also read that 50-80% of adults have HSV-1. Is there any information on how many people have it, yet don't show symptoms? Also, if some one tests positive to having HSV-1 antibodies, does this mean that I would not be able to transmit it to them? Meaning, if someone has antibodies for oral herpes, does that make them immune to getting genital herpes?","January 29, 2017 at 7:03 pm",1 Reply,"About Aramat13

veryveryupset,https://www.inspire.com/m/veryveryupset/,"Just yesterday i found this little blister/zit thing on my inner labia, very close to my vagina entrance. I am female, never had sexual intercourse. the only sexual contact i have ever had is I gave my ex bf oral sex twice, but that was two years ago.
i am on the tail end of having the flu, and during the week i had it my hygiene wasn't very good. after i took a shower the little blister felt okay, it didn't hurt/itch anymore.
This morning it's much smaller (because it was very inflamed and i tried to ""pop"" it last night), but still there.

amiimaginingthis,https://www.inspire.com/m/amiimaginingthis/,"27m
This all started last week on Thursday. I had protected sex (both the oral I received and PiV was protected; I did not give oral) with a one night stand. Later that night I got the fear thinking I saw something on the underside of my penis. It was reddish pink and I thought I saw a growth as well. Admittedly I don't look at the underside that much so it could have been normal. I didn't feel anything odd (no itching or burning or other pain) so I just kept an eye on it.

I also knew it was way too early for that encounter to have given me anything that would show up that fast so I just took some pics and tried to forget. I could not forget. I obsessed over it googling symptoms and reading things over and over until I was convinced that I had herpes or warts. I couldn't think about anything else no matter how hard I tried.

Well, that's when things get weird. On Saturday night and into Sunday I started feeling very bloated. I then realised I hadn't done a good shit in a while. Now I was adding that to the symptom checkers and other google searches. My lower abdomen was puffy and it was more discomfort than pain. I took some laxatives and in an hour or 2 I had a massive shit and felt a bit better. But during the constipation by balls (up near my groin) started to get sore. None of these were that bad or painful, just noticeable. I knew I was being hyper-aware of changes in my body but I couldn't help it.

Now it's Tuesday and the sore hasn't changed (if anything, it's less red and I'm sure now it's just part of my normal circumcision scar), bloating has gone away and the testicle soreness is all but gone (I think me thinking about it makes me aware of any sensation even if they're not sore) but now I feel a small sensation in my urethral opening. It's not pain or 'burning' and the closest term I have come across is 'urethral awareness'.

So, what started as a fear of herpes now has me ravenously googling chlamydia symptoms. I don't (or haven't yet) had any discharge from my penis and urinating doesn't hurt or come more frequently than normal. I've also masturbated a couple of times (I didn't for the first few days when I thought I was getting a sore on my shaft) to make sure that everything was working ok. Normal semen, no pain, and nothing else out of place.

I think I may just be being paranoid, but I am planning on getting checked this week anyway. I mean, what are the chances that what starts out as a fear from seeing a spot on my penis could turn into actually having chlamydia?? I have also googled the shit out of Prostatitis and male UTI's (which could be caused by constipation, I read).","January 17, 2017 at 12:38 pm",1 Reply,"About amiimaginingthis

ErikInspire,https://www.inspire.com/m/ErikInspire/,"Earlier this year, we had a wonderful discussion with all of you about Facebook-style “Like” buttons on Inspire, and all of the positives and negatives that are associated with them. Through more than 200 replies we heard from many of you with widely differing opinions. The overwhelming consensus was that, while the idea of being able to give reactions to posts and comments could be a positive one, the idea of using Facebook-style reactions (Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad, Angry) were inappropriate for a site like Inspire.

So we spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of reactions we could use that would make sense for Inspire. How could we give our members another chance to interact with posts and comments, especially on mobile phones? So today we present to you Inspire reactions.

On every post and comment you will be able to select one or more of three reactions. We hope that these are self-explanatory, but I did want to show you what we were thinking in our selections.

First, we wanted you to be able to show your Support for something that another member wrote, whether they were posting something positive or struggling with something heart-wrenching. That’s why we chose the first reaction to be Support, with the Inspire icon, so you can reach out and let the other member know that you are thinking about them.

Second, we wanted you to be able to give your Thanks to someone for what they wrote. This is your way of showing another member that you appreciate what they said, and that they added to the ongoing discussion.

Finally, we wanted you to be able to indicate something as Useful, meaning that the post or comment contains valuable information that you think other Inspire members should read. This is a very important reaction for us, because soon it will help to inform the Read More posts and search results. The more a post is marked as Useful, the more likely it will be to show up for other members who need your help.

Along with these new reactions, we have also made the Reply button much more prominent. Since replies are now written right where you hit the button, rather than jumping to the bottom of the page, we hope to emphasize that there is nothing better than a personal reply.

We hope you enjoy the new reaction buttons, and I personally am thankful to all of you who took the time to participate in our discussion thread earlier this year.","December 1, 2016 at 2:08 pm",334 Replies,"About ErikInspire

ErikInspire,https://www.inspire.com/m/ErikInspire/,"You’ve probably noticed for the last few days the new little microphone that has appeared on the right side of text boxes when you write a new post or comment. That new feature is called Voice-to-Text. If you click on it, and if you have a microphone, you can speak your text instead of typing it and have it appear on the screen. If you have a phone or tablet, this should happen automatically, but if you are on a desktop computer, you’ll need either a built-in microphone or an external microphone for it to work.

The translation of your voice to text happens as you talk, so you can see the words appear on your screen while you are talking. Inspire doesn’t get the audio, just the text. The magic happens entirely within your browser, so we also can’t control the accuracy of the results; we are just enabling your browser to do the translation. Depending on your browser, your microphone, external noise, and lots of other factors, you might find highly accurate results, or you might find lots of mistakes. We’ve enabled this feature because we want to make it easier for people who have difficulty typing, and we encourage you to use it or ignore it depending on your needs.

If you do use it, here are some suggestions to make your life easier:
Speak at a normal conversational speed, but using good diction, as if you were on a slightly crackly phone connection.
Say your punctuation aloud! You can say period, comma, question mark, exclamation point, and new paragraph. All of these will be translated appropriately.
Watch your words as you type. Depending on your browser, it will eventually stop translating, at which point you will have to click on the microphone button again.
There have been a lot of other changes over the past few months as well. Here’s just a few:
I hope everyone has seen how much faster the site is. Our engineering team underwent a huge effort to change Inspire’s hosting in August and September, and most community and journal pages now load in about one-fifth of the time that they used to.
We implemented “Infinite Scroll” on community home pages, so that you don’t have to click through to new pages to see more content. This will be coming to your member home page and thread replies as well.
We made it easier to reply directly to a comment. Now if you click the Reply button, the reply box opens up right there, so you can see the comment you are replying to, rather than to scroll down to the bottom of the screen. Along with that, when one comment is in reply to another comment, and you see the text In Reply To ####### by username - Show Post, you can click on Show Post to have the text of the original reply appear. This makes it easier to follow a conversation within the thread.
So what’s coming in the next few months? There are lots of exciting changes still to see, but I thought I would highlight two of the most important major changes to come.
We are making significant improvements to our search engine. We all know that our search engine needs work, and we are currently engaging in a complete overhaul of the search system. It’s a complicated task, but it is a high priority for us, and we promise you that you will like the result a great deal.
We have brand new pages coming soon on conditions, treatments and symptoms, full of great information directly from the National Institutes of Health.
I hope this was helpful for you! I am proud every day of the communities that you have built at Inspire. Together, we’re better.

Warmly,

patrick9406,https://www.inspire.com/m/patrick9406/,I found my wart during February of this year. I know exactly who I got it from because he had a wart too that he was convinced was a skin tag or something else unimportant (the amount of times i have thought about that conversation is astounding). I was being silly and I did have sex without a condom with him and so I am not surprised I got it. I went to have it removed in May of this year and it was an uncomfortable experience but mainly because I went all by myself and didn't feel comfortable enough to tell anyone about what had happened to me. It was during this time after having the wart removed that I began to evaluate the relationship I was in and realize that it was unhealthy and feeling scared about having to tell someone about my HPV and all that it could mean for them is not a reason for me to stay in an unhealthy relationship. I am currently seeing someone who I have known for a very long time and a few weeks ago I was honest with him about my HPV and the type that I have and the uncetainty that goes along with it. He was understanding and kind but hesistant which I understand. Finding out that I have this strain of HPV has taken me through a roller coaster of emotions. I have been at the lowest of lows and even considered self harm. Being honest with the person who I like helped me to feel better and take control of it and do what I can to protect him but I still feel like I will never feel whole again. I need to know the truth about having sex again after this. I know that it is a common thing and that so many people are asymptomatic but I don't want to have to make a decision about his sexual health without all of the facts. I recently went on a trip this past week and every day I thought about letting him go and how I would be happy to if it meant he was okay and I wasn't responsible for hurting him. So at the end of this long and I'm sure confusing post I just want some answers or some advice. Will I ever feel like my old self again? Will I be able to have sex with someone without feeling dread over the thought of infecting them? How do I move on from this and not let it define me. My sexuality was never the defining feature of who I was before this but now it seems to be all I think about and all I base my self worth on. I want answers and I want to stop getting the impression that every health care provider just wants me to join a convent.,"November 30, 2016 at 1:38 pm",1 Reply,"About patrick9406

Brian,https://www.inspire.com/m/Brian/,"As we approach Thanksgiving, many of us pause to reflect on what we are thankful for. The older I get, the more I realize that what really matters to me, far more than anything else, are my family and friends and colleagues at Inspire, the people who are close to me.

In the past year alone, three of my friends have been diagnosed with cancer. Each time I heard the news I was sad, scared, and felt an overwhelming desire to help. I know many of you know what this is like: the rush of emotions, concern, and wanting to do something to make the person better. And recently I have realized I am thankful for some of the ways a cancer diagnosis is different today than it was even 20 short years ago:

- Our society has changed in ways that make it easier to discuss cancer. While taboos and stigma still exist, it is less of a hushed topic.

- It is much easier for me to stay in touch with my friends, even when I live hours away. Long distance calls are nearly free, and my friends and I can video chat and send email and text messages any time of day.

- With online community, we can deeply connect with others who are going through the same things as we are. One of the best examples of this I’ve seen is the participation in this recent thread about how cancer has changed our lives.

- It is much easier to access scientific research about cancer, learn what treatments are being used, and educate ourselves in preparation for conversations with physicians. Just 20 years ago, it was difficult for most of us to access scientific research.

What are you thankful for? What are some of the things, small or large, that make you happy?

As we approach the holiday, I wish you all a safe and happy Thanksgiving.

Together we’re better,

ErikInspire,https://www.inspire.com/m/ErikInspire/,"Inspire community members,

One of the concerns that has been expressed most often this year has been a change to the way we handle inactive posts. Before a change in late 2015, Inspire closed all posts that were inactive for more than 90 days, so that no new comments could be added. Last year, we lifted this closure so that comments could still be placed on older posts.

Many of you have written, in eloquent terms, against that decision.

We were trying to allow conversation to continue on topics of importance. We average over 900 new members per day, and wanted to make sure that everyone could be a part of the discussion.

However, in doing so, we inadvertently caused some pain and hardship. This was particularly true in cases where a beloved member had passed away, and a thread about them or their passing was brought back up again. This became even more of an issue with the new ""Read Next"" feature, which has been very successful, but which also has surfaced lots of old content.

At your request, today we have gone back to our older guidelines. Discussions and Journals that have not had activity for more than 90 days will be automatically closed. You will still be able to read those posts, but no new comments can be made. Soon there will be a message in place of the Reply box, encouraging members to start a new post instead.

Thank you very much for your kind, honest feedback on this issue.","November 8, 2016 at 3:36 pm",94 Replies,"About ErikInspire

richie0789,https://www.inspire.com/m/richie0789/,"Hi,
I visited asian massage parlour, they said they are free from any std/diseases so I had a blow job with condom and later the massage girl placed 2nd condom on the first one and I had vaginal sex upon her conforming she is safe(not sure but she said, i see her vagina clean) and sex for less than a minute and I ejaculated and slowly removed(it is my first time). she then took of the condoms and sprayed some liquid on my genitals( said it is alcohol) . I went to restroom, pee and washed my genitals. I am having sleepless nights for the mistake I had done

What are the chances of HIV/STDs?
How many days it takes to notice STD symptoms?
The massage girl says she never had sex without condom and she is safe and she didnot let me kiss or finger her.

I had a few blisters on my penis and went directly to the doctor, he told me it was a staff infection from work. He perscibed antibiotics and it went away. I have never had a significant out break.
Recently my wife passed away and in order to get on with my life I decided to get tested to make certain. My results were positive for type 1 and 2. What a shock.
I was with my wife for over a year before this happened. I have contacted sexual partners prior to her and all have no symptoms. Thank God.
So my question is, could I have gotten this from a patient if I had contact without gloves. Not that it matters at this point but I guess knowing where I got it would give me some peace of mind.","October 19, 2016 at 3:10 pm",4 Replies,"About lonny66

Dear members,
Starting today, some Inspire team members will attend Stanford Medicine’s Medicine X, a wonderful conference that genuinely focuses on patients and caregivers. Inspire co-founder and CEO Brian Loew has made presentations at Medicine X before, and he will be doing so again. Additionally, Inspire is a sponsor of the event this year.

There are literally dozens of interesting sessions, and we're excited to announce that Inspire and Medicine X are collaborating on the Medicine X Halftime Show, which are special online interview segments that will take place tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday. Brian Loew will be co-hosting the segments with patient advocate Michael Seres of Medicine X. Brian and Michael will interview patient advocates and industry leaders. You can watch the Halftime Show segments right here on Inspire, via the livestream video links below:

Friday, Sept. 16, noon to 12:30 p.m. PST: Patient advocacy: How to empower and get everyone included



Saturday, Sept. 17, noon to 12:30 p.m. PST: What does patient centricity really mean to pharma?



Sunday, Sept. 18, 12:45 to 1:15 p.m. PST: Cancer Moonshot: How can patients fuel change

Regardless of what has brought you here to Inspire, we believe you can benefit from watching sessions at Medicine X, and from the Halftime Show segments as well. If there are questions you may have for the panelists at any of the sessions I listed above, or topics you’d like discussed, please let us know.

When we have been at Medicine X, we see what is possible for better healthcare when patients are truly part of the conversation. We have tried to carry with us to Medicine X your collected wisdom and comradery, and we pledge to do so again this year.

Please stay tuned here on Inspire for more updates, and thanks.

Lastly, if you’re attending the conference, please message me or email us at team@inspire.com and it’d be wonderful if we can meet. For those of you who want to view the conference live, please sign up for the free conference livestream to allow you to watch the sessions.

Together we’re better,

Karissa88,https://www.inspire.com/m/Karissa88/,Last August 2015 I had sex with my boyfriend now ex boyfriend for a month straight. I thought I was in love and all that jazz. Well in October I got the signs of herpes and I thought I was going to die. I was SO sick. I missed work and couldn't get out of bed for 3 days. I went to the doctor and he unfortunately told me that I more then likely have genital herpes. I was devistated. I didn't want to talk to anyone and completely shut the world out. But the one thing that I was upset about is I was deceived. My bf at the time didn't tell me he had anything. So therefore that's what hurts the most is I could have had a choice. I could have been told. I never thought of an std to be honest. I always just didn't want to get pregnant. So when I found out it was positive that I had genital herpes I was and still am very angry and I did have a few suicidal thoughts and have been suffering from depression. And whenever I think of him deceiving me and that sex was so important to him that he didn't think of destroying someone else's life I get very angry and really upset. I used to be a very positive person and have a healthy outlook on life. I used to smile all the time. And u used to see purpose in everything and get excited about things. Now I feel like such a downer. Does anybody have any suggestions to help me out on being myself again? I want to feel like a normal person again and not like I have a target on my forehead that I have an std and that I ruined my life by one mistake.,"June 30, 2016 at 9:19 pm",23 Replies,"About Karissa88

eliz013,https://www.inspire.com/m/eliz013/,"Hello,
I am a 30 year old female. I gave unprotected oral sex to a man 11 days ago and i am concerned about my risk of having caught an std.
He had no visible signs of an std, and he claims he never has.
2-3 days ago i noticed a small white bump on my tongue, and today a small bump near the opening of my vagina. That being said... the bump on my tongue is the same as small ulcers i have had before, and seems to be getting better, and the bump near my vagina seems very much like a pimple and does not fit the description of a wart.
I had required std testing last year as a new patient at my doctor, and i have only had one partner since then.
But... i have been feeling extremely anxious and paranoid and am wondering if all the little things i am starting to see are because of stress! (I also have a history of anxiety and panic attacks)
Could you please tell based on that info what my risk is, and if the small bumps sound like signs of a std?

whyme111,https://www.inspire.com/m/whyme111/,"Well, my story goes like this. I am 32 about to be 33 right now. I was sexually active most of my life, but used condoms except a handful of times. I was diagnosised with Genital warts Feb/March 2014. It was kind of devastating for me because I was single at the time and trying to find somebody serious to date/marry. I did cyro/freezing and Zyclara and cleared the virus June/July 2014. During this time I was working out, eating healthy, and limiting alcohol/drugs.

Then in Feb of 2016 I noticed a spot not that big on a different part of my private area. I finally went to get it checked out June 2016 thinking it was a skin tag and sure enough it was a wart. Got another prescription of Zyclara and went back the following week as I noticed 2 other spots. She also attempted to freeze off a skin tag that she said could be a wart or a skin tag. Its a skin tag I have had my whole life, but I let her do it anyways.

When I found it was another instance of GW I ended up going crazy and ordered this vitamin cocktail of 200$+ worth of vitamins this month including AHCC, Shiitake, Reisha, probiotic, green tea, and a bunch of other vitamins. I know my immune system was weak the first half of 2016 as I abusing alcohol/drugs more regularly (drugs once a month/ alcohol 2-3 times a week) while in a relationship with my ex this year and last, not working out or eating healthy, and even smoke a couple cigs. I began using tobacco dip while I was studing for a this stressful exam.

Also the person I was with admitted to being with somebody else during the end of my relationship, but I was faithful the entire time. I am upset at myself really for all these things, but now trying to get into the best shape of my life and take these vitamins all over again.

Why would I have another event pretty much 20 months after seeing my last one? Am I going to have active warts the rest of my life will this thing ever clear and never come back? Thats what I think about and it bothers me. Maybe I got another HPV as my partner was cheating and now it has flared up my HPV with a new strain and my weak immune system. Kind of just giving up on love and all that until I get clearance again, and get into better shape. Maybe I can meet somebody along the way in my fitness journey who knows. I was also really stressed out with work the past 12 months, had stress in my relationship, and I work 12 hour night shifts sometimes so my sleep sucks.

Any advice from somebody who has gone through this or is going through this?

I am taking the vitamins below, but also taking Reishi, Turkey Tail, AHCC, probiotic, Green Tea Extract GCHG...

I have yet to even start on a family and that is something that I was looking forward to, but now the future of having one doesn't seem promising to me. I have shut myself off from the world pretty much, only going to work, church and a few family members houses and that's it. I having such a hard time with this.

ErikInspire,https://www.inspire.com/m/ErikInspire/,"My name is Erik Jones, and I am the Vice President of Product and Data Science at Inspire. This is the first post in what will be an occasional series of updates to share with you some of the newest features of Inspire, and what might be coming in the future.

Soon, we’re going to make it easier for you to begin discussions or journal postings. At the top of each feed of posts, whether on your personal home page or the community page, you’ll have the ability to create a new post right there on the page. On a community home page, you’ll be able to start a discussion in that community. On your personal home page, you’ll be able to start a journal that you can post to any number of the communities that you belong to.

So what’s the difference between a journal and a discussion? We get this question a lot. Fundamentally, there’s really only one difference: Discussions can be posted in only one community, whereas journals can be posted in as many communities as you belong to. Journals can even be posted in zero communities, if you want to share something with only your friends. And when you read a journal’s comments, you might be reading comments from people who belong to other communities besides your own.

Almost 90% of our members belong to only one community. A lot of people see Inspire as being synonymous with their community. But did you know that Inspire has over 200 different communities? It’s true! Inspire is the largest health-focused social network on the Internet. If you want to see what other communities we have, go to www.inspire.com/groups and see what else we have to offer. Inspire’s mission is to connect you with others who know what you’re going through, and there are many communities here where you might find the support you need.

Thanks for letting me introduce myself to you. Feel free to add your own thoughts in the discussion below. Next time, we’ll talk about Like buttons, why we haven’t had Like buttons in the past, and what we are thinking about doing in the future.","March 1, 2016 at 11:16 am",240 Replies,"About ErikInspire

Hi All, just a little bit about my health ....

I have Psoriasis, Scalp P, arthritis throughout my entire body, three herniated discs, all of them pressing on my sciatica and colon, and another with a tear. I also have Rosacea all over my face and ears are itchy from that, too. I itch all the time. I also have HSV which tortures me in so many ways. Update: I now have something wrong in my neck (probably a disc or bone on bone) which is making my life HELL! Shooting pains down my left arm, weakness in that arm and I can't sleep more than a couple of hours at a time. I've tried it all, & I've used it all, so please, spare me the coconut oil responses. Just here to give some support to any one who's miserable like me. A bit of mary jane helps me control the itching. And a little bit of alcohol helps me not go crazy from all the physical misery. Cheers!

Thanks to this website I have someone to talk to about my aches, worries and pains....thanks for listening!! And thanks to all of the posts and groups on here, I've learned SO MUCH."

Dear members,
I am writing to share with you Hope Aguilar's ""Why we must talk about cancer,"" a guest column for the Philadelphia Inquirer's ""Diagnosis: Cancer,"" a new online resource of news and commentary about cancer. Inspire is partnering with the Inquirer to help bring Hope's voice and others to its readers.

You can read Hope's column here. An ovarian cancer survivor, she said of her advocacy work, ""I haven’t stopped talking about my story and I won’t stop talking about it. Continuing the conversation offers the potential of saving lives. I truly believe that.""

We invite you to share her column and offer your insights.

We have a series of videos on herpes and one in particular might be of special interest. I'm pasting the introductory blurb and the link below so please take a look if you're newly diagnosed or even if you've had HSV for a while and still not sure what to do.

Three Things to Know Three Things to Know When You’re Diagnosed with Herpes

--Recently got the news you have herpes and not sure what the hell to do? Give our friend Samuel Glickman five minutes and he’ll explain three key points to shift your perspective.

“This is not a catastrophic diagnosis….much more like a flat tire than a total car wreck. You will be fine. Trust me on this one.

“I don’t want you to think anything has been removed for you as far as the future, getting married, having a great sex life. No. Those are all fears, illusions. Someone once taught me that fear stands for False Evidence Appearing Real.

“Practice good self-care in these days when you need it most. You have to be your own best friend. Nourish yourself, inside and outside.”","June 27, 2016 at 6:05 pm",0 Replies,"About Fredo101

weremethyst,https://www.inspire.com/m/weremethyst/,"I was sexually assaulted almost three days ago. An old man who I didn't know forced me to ""make out"" with him and to perform unprotected oral sex on him (although this only lasted for around a minute or two before I got away). I have a lot of anxiety issues and I'm really worried about STIs. I can't even sleep at night because of it. I'm only 21 years old and that was my first sexual experience, unfortunately. It was especially traumatizing because I am a lesbian. Could anyone help me to ease my worries? I'm not sure if I can afford to go get tested and I also live with my parents, and I wouldn't want them to know.

I feel a little sore spot on my lip, but it's possible that it's from not drinking enough water and my lips becoming chapped. That's almost what it feels like, but I can never be sure.

""It’s been two and a half years since I got sick. What started as pain in my left tricep has turned into intermittent full body pain, extreme exhaustion and smidgen of memory loss as a side effect of a medication,"" Emma wrote. ""Doctors have never been able to find out what is wrong with me. Of the rare disease community I am part of, a small subgroup that lives in painful mystery, always wondering if one day medical science will have the tools to figure me and the rest of us out.""

DP1989,https://www.inspire.com/m/DP1989/,"Over a year ago I noticed (what I thought were) two ingrown hairs in my pubic region, one just below the shaft of my penis and the other about 2 inches away near my left leg. From memory they were sore like an ingrown hair and I left them to heal on their own as I suffer from ingrown hairs quite frequently. However, after always blowing them off as a bump from the ingrown hair that never healed, I had a proper look at them for the first time and they look very like warts. They are very dark in appearance (I'm dark skinned) and seem to have cauliflowered. Over the past year they have not spread to anywhere else nor do I have any on my actual penis. From looking at pictures of skin tags and genital warts on the web it is hard to determine what this is.
Is it possible that the infected ingrown hairs developed into skin tags over the past year?

secretsofnimh,https://www.inspire.com/m/secretsofnimh/,"I'm so scatterbrained. I've been Googling and stocking up on information since I received the phone call from my gynecologist this afternoon.
She confirmed that I tested positive for hpv, more specifically one of the strains that causes cervical cancer.
Well, I probably confused the woman with my response filled with laughter....(my mom was just diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma. So.....well....I could only laugh.) Before this result, I was told I have BV, which they gave me antibiotics for....and at the beginning of may I have an appointment at the Dysplasia unit....for a colpscopy. Maybe a biopsy.

Okay, so there's a chance I don't have cancer. Honestly I'm not that worried. Everyone is getting cancer this year.... hence my laughter. Something's gotta give eventually. I'll live like a freaking firework in the meantime. :D

My concern is with the HPV, with there being no cure. Pretty sure I got it when I was drunk and someone took advantage of the situation....even though ""I kept falling and he had to hold me up"" (his words) I had a sore head from a fall I didn't remember....and a guy telling me he is glad I feel the same about him. Uh...what? Turns out he was a sex offender. F***ing hell. Pretty sure he gave me both.
Anyhow....I'm not keen on having to discuss this with a future s/o (though I most definitely will!) I'm also not okay with the idea that I could make him a carrier....and should we break up and he doesn't inform his new gf to get vaccinated then he's just passing it on....because of me. If that's not some demented responsibility.
I also feel dirty. Gross. I have an incurable std? Poop.

Also I have Mirena currently which I read heightens the chance of BV...which adds to the severity of HPV as does contraception.
But I got the thing in the first place because of my 90% cycle clots. It was
pretty much just gelatin globs. Yuck. Scary too. Probably caused BV.
I'm at an impasse. Need to talk to my gyno. Thankfully I have an appointment with her on the 26th.","April 19, 2016 at 4:12 am",1 Reply,"About secretsofnimh

getodacicus,https://www.inspire.com/m/getodacicus/,"Dear all,

I am a 35 years old man. When I was 23 I had a few sexual contacts (about 6 or 7) with whores. All sexual contacts were done using condom. At that time I was thinking that I am protected from STD's if I use condom. I was sucking female nipples during the sexual contacts for about 2 times. During one time I think some milk was spread into my mouth and I remember that I had swallowed it.
After about 7 years, in 2010 there started health problems with symptoms like HIV, namely:
- very strong flu
- very painful enlarged lymph nodes
- rash on scalp (very itchy)
- dry cough (asthma)
- chest pain
In 2012 started chronic fatigue with neurological symptoms: since then I experience extremely fatigue and can not work, I have muscle weakness (like semi paralysis ), I can not focus
In 2014 started abdominal pain
In 2015 started oral herpes-es and kind of hives eruption at a few months interval
I have done several HIV tests starting with 2010 (6 years after risky sexual exposure) and all were NEGATIVE. Also I tested negative on hepatitis B and C, syphilis, HHV6.
Do you know what other sexual diseases, except HIV, could generate AIDS like symptoms?

Thank you

Brian,https://www.inspire.com/m/Brian/,"Dear members,

Today, February 29th, is Rare Disease Day. At least 7,000 rare diseases have been discovered, but treatments exist for only 400 of these. It is likely that someone you know has a rare disease, as over 300 million people worldwide are living with one.

I am pleased to share with you a Rare Voice infographic we created in recognition of all of the 175,000 Inspire members with a rare disease, 46 rare disease support groups, and our incredible nonprofit partners.

We also worked with a number of you to have your voices featured in Patients talk about the frustration and loneliness of rare diseases published by Philadelphia Inquirer yesterday. Some of you even shared a video story about your experiences, and you can watch the video by clicking here.

I invite you to share all of the links above: the Rare Voice infographic, the article, and the video, to help raise awareness about the power of rare voices. I would also love to hear more of your thoughts about and experiences with rare disease.

Together we're better,
Brian

ErikInspire,https://www.inspire.com/m/ErikInspire/,"We hope you enjoy the new feature that has been launched today. Now on any community home page you can start a new discussion right there, without having to click through to a new page. We wanted to make it easier for all of you to create content, especially on a tablet or mobile phone. If it goes well, we will roll it out to your member home page as well. After you post, remember that it can be a few minutes before it shows up in the feed. Your feedback is welcome!

One change to the user interface that has been requested by a number of users is a ""Like"" button, or possibly one with many different reactions, similar to the feature that Facebook rolled out last month. There are many good things about having these buttons. Mainly, they allow for you, the members, to quickly react to someone's post or reply without having to take the time to write a reply of your own. We hear that members often don't have the time to write a full reply to a post, but want to be able to share their pleasure or sympathy to someone's words.

On the negative side, we have concerns that this will dilute the quality of the content. Inspire has the best patient-focused medical communities on the Internet, and the biggest reason is because of the quality of content that our members create. If having reaction buttons causes people to be less likely to write content, is that a price worth paying?

I admit to personally being skeptical of Like and reaction buttons for exactly that reason. However, we really want to hear what all of you think. Feel free to discuss this here, but we'd like to encourage you to take a one-question poll on this matter. You can find it at:

sistmu,https://www.inspire.com/m/sistmu/,"Hey,

about myself: I´m 25 years old, male and I have sex with other males. I don´t suffer from any other diseases except the symptoms I will be naming. I practise sports on a regular basis (20km jogging / week). BMI: 22,8.

Since about two years I have been suffering from different symptoms. I have been to a general practitioner, dermatologists, a proctologist and urologists. I have not been diagnosed with anything.

The symptoms:

- glans: change of skin from smooth to wrinkly / rough; reddening mostly at the slit; infrequently a short sharp pain from inside urinary passage; no pain when peeing

- bottom : itching anus; reddening; occasionally a little blood on the toilet paper; occasionally feeling of pressure deeper inside (difficult to locate exactly)

- throat : dry; reddening; slightly bloody slime; regularly balls of purulence in the slime (1-6 mm)

- feet, toes and hands: ongoing problems with athletes foot. Not sure if there is any connection to the other problems, but it got worse at the same time as everything else occurred

- thorax: these symptoms are most annoying; dry cough, ongoing feeling of dryness; very sensitive to air conditioning / heating; no difficulties in breathing

- eyes: dry (mostly in the morning); no reddening

- generally: exhaustion; all symptoms become worse after alcohol consumption or eating sugar

Recently I began salt water inhalation with a vaporizer. It helps with all the symptoms (even bottom and glans) except the feet, toes and hands, if performed regularly.

I have been tested negative for syphilis, HIV, chlamydia and gonorrhoea. However I am still concerned about a chlamydia infection and wonder whether a test result could be influenced by the fact that the infection might have been caused a longer time ago. I assume that it would be a STD, because at the time the symptoms occurred, I had many sex partners and performed “deep throat” on a regular basis.

On my bottom I have had treatments because of haemorrhoids, which did not affect the symptoms.

Two sex partners from the last couple of moths complained about similar symptoms, particularly in the respiratory system, which is why I fear a risk of contagion and perform even oral sex only with condoms.

I wonder what my problem could be and would be very grateful for any advice.","April 2, 2016 at 9:23 pm",1 Reply,"About sistmu

kellyeverson,https://www.inspire.com/m/kellyeverson/,"Introduction
According to a recent research, in every relationship there are things that each partner desires to have but they are just too afraid to say to avoid judgement from their partners or even themselves. How you were socially brought up significantly influences your choices and how you handle your partner. Depending on your social norms and rules you are bound to shy off from asking your partner for some things in bed. For a strong and long-lasting relationship, each partner is expected to understand and meet their partner’s needs and desires in bed. Sex is a flavour that helps strengthen relationship by serving as a means of forming a strong attachment or bond between partners. Therefore, it is very important to put the social norms and rules aside and ask for whatever you want or desire in bed without feeling unladylike or anti-feminist.
Rough sex
Most women always want to try a new thing every time they have sex to make it more interesting. Most women desire to have rough sex and experience the arousal that is accompanied by hard sex but are too afraid to tell their partners because they are socially drilled to believe that hard sex is degrading and misogynistic to women. Hard sex involves spanking, hair pulling, chocking and face slapping. If you desire to experiment beyond missionary sex, it is always good to start from somewhere though you may not be willing to tell your partner. Although rough sex does not only involve physical assault, start from the simple drills and later advance on them depending on your partner’s reaction.
Dirty talk
Women are so indifferent when it comes to sexual matters. It takes different things, ideas and positions to get different women sexually aroused or satisfied. Although most women are afraid of engaging into dirty talks with their partners, dirty talk before sex may be just the solution to your sexual problems. Sexual arousal in men is greatly influenced by what men see but for women it is a little bit complicated. Women are not just aroused by the pure site of the penis or fondling of boobs but their arousal is significantly mentally driven. Therefore, engaging in dirty talks can be the answer to the mental arousal trick. Dirty talk is one of the natural ways to increase stamina in bed.
Watching porn
Although girls watch porn, they restrain from asking for it because the culture restricts girls from watching porn. Most of us watch porn but we are afraid of talking about it. Women are aroused by different things including watching porn; therefore, if porn is your thing but you are afraid of asking for it, try suggesting it as a treat for your partner. According to relationship experts, not everything that men like works on women. Trying new sexual styles and moves is the key to maintain an interesting sexual life. You can easily learn these new moves by enticing your partner that you both watch the porn that works for you. There are various natural ways to increase stamina in bed and watching porn is one of them.
Anal sex
Although not many women desire to have anal sex, some women are curious about anal sex and desire to give it a try. It is very tricky to bring up the anal sex topic. Most men perceive anal sex as a form of degrading them or even the women. Therefore, it is advisable to plan for it and take time to fully put the idea in his head and when the right time comes you will have your chance.
Submissive/dominant role playing
Just like men, women desire to have time to take control or just lie down and get ravaged depending on their feelings but are just too afraid to tell their partners. Women feel by asking for sexual dominance they might emasculate their guys or act anti-feminist but you may be surprised that some men desire to be submissive at times. Therefore, you should keep in mind that the bedroom is not a place to let your ego and feminism dominate you but a place to let yourself have the maximum fun and total satisfaction.
Conclusion
The bedroom is not a place to let your ego, social norms and rules and feminism take control but a place to let all your desires explode and experience the world like you never did before. Although it is difficult to ask for all your sexual desires, it all begins from somewhere. The trick is to start from somewhere and gauge your partner’s reactions and later advance on the successful simple tricks that your partner also appreciates or likes.

Dear members,
I am writing to share with you Sara Wyen’s "" The importance of providing patient support in the face of a life-threatening illness,” a new guest column for Stanford Medicine's ""Scope"" medical blog.

You can read her column here: http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2016/01/19/the-importance-of-provi....

Sara is patient advocate and blogger, and also is manager of communications and health marketing at the National Blood Clot Alliance, an Inspire partner.

After being diagnosed with the autoimmune disorder APS, Wyen said in her column that she struggled to understand APS and to begin advocating for herself.

“The most frustrating part was that to everyone on the outside, I looked and seemed fine,” she wrote, “but I was fighting the biggest battle of my life. I felt betrayed by my body, which I had taken great strides to take care of with healthy eating and exercise. I felt completely isolated by what was happening to me, and doctor support became crucial during the extensive recovery period.”

We invite you to leave feedback on the Stanford blog site.

Thanks. Together we're better,

iUDAME,https://www.inspire.com/m/iUDAME/,"She was my sister, my motivator, my inspiration, my protector and my best friend.
When she passed away, it left a hole in my heart that can never be filled.

In 2010 my sister, at the young age of 32 years old, had a massive heart attack while her two beautiful daughters were asleep in the next room.
She did not survive.
No matter what we do or where we go in life, there is no way to know what moment will be our last.
She was a veteran, and a week before she died, my sister Samantha, just graduated as an RN.
She dedicated her life and career to helping people.

On May 19th, 2010, she was proud and excited about her life and where it was heading.
Samantha went jogging with her daughter, came home, cooked dinner for her children and updated her Facebook status.
She called my mom and sister to check in. Her plan was to put her children to bed, take a shower and call my mom and sister back.

She called, but not excited anymore. Now she was terrified.
Samantha had just been awoken by the scalding hot water in the shower. Yes I said Awoken!
She found herself on the floor of the tub with no idea of how she had gotten there.
Her first thought was to call the family.
They told her to call 911 and she said she would call her ex husband first to come watch the children, so she can go to the hospital.
He told her to leave the door unlocked he is rushing over and will be there in 5 minutes.

When he arrived it was too late. She was on the couch unresponsive.
CPR didn't work and when EMS arrived she was too far gone.

We found out later that her next door neighbor was an EMT and he was home.
What if she could have told him something was wrong and she needed help?
What if she didn't have to choose between calling family and calling emergency services?
What if someone could have gotten there sooner?
What if.....?
What if.....?
What if.....?

This question haunts me everyday. I had to do something about it.
So I created an app. The app is called iUDAME (pronounced eye-you-da'-may) or Ayudame'.
In spanish Ayudame' means ""Help Me.""

In the push of a button, this app allows you to notify emergency services and your loved ones that something is wrong and you need help.
The app shows your real-time location and tells you when people are on the way to help.

I know what it is like to lose someone to sudden crisis, so I want to help others to avoid that pain an suffering.
Autistic children and the elderly go missing everyday. Rough numbers estimate, one goes missing every 45 seconds in the US alone. For this reason, we have added features that allow you to monitor the whereabouts of your children or elderly parent.
If they go missing, you will have the ability to identify their location and if necessary, alert emergency services.

Please download this app and help protect yourself and your loved ones.
Download it for Android (https://goo.gl/61C3Qo) or Apple (https://goo.gl/KyFoov)
Our website is www.iUDAME.com

Thank You for reading.
I hope my hurt can help someone else.
Be safe. Be well.

Dear members,
We are partnering with a publisher, FiercePharma, on a article related to direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising of pharmaceuticals.

The FiercePharma writer is seeking the opinions of patients--particularly those affected by diseases for which there are prescription treatments that are advertised in a direct-to-consumer fashion. Has a DTC ad ever prompted you to seek more information about a treatment for yourself or a loved one?

DTC pharmaceutical ads are ones that appear on television, in magazines and newspapers, and on the Internet. Just last month, the American Medical Association urged a ban on DTC prescription drug and medical device ads. The AMA claims DTC advertising “inflates demand for new and more expensive drugs,” while proponents say DTC ads inform consumers about important, treatable health conditions and encourage doctor/patient dialogue.

The FiercePharma journalist is asking for insights of Inspire members who live in the US, and who are willing to provide basic descriptions of themselves with regard to their Inspire membership. A sample description would be “a 35-year-old California woman with fibromyalgia,” or “a 56-year-old New York man with thyroid cancer.”

The writer is researching the article for FiercePharmaMarketing, which covers pharmaceutical marketing news with a special focus on consumer advertising and new drug launches. If you would like to share your insights for the article, please do so by emailing me at john@inspire.com and including “DTC” in the subject line.

If you have any questions regarding this request, please email me and I'll reply as soon as possible.

Thanks in advance, and thanks for being members of the Inspire community.

Never had fever, never had swollen lymph nodes or rashes, tested 5 times over 10 months for HIV, last test was done at the 10th month and they all came back negative (4th Generation HIV testes in two different labs).
I have also been tested for Herpes 1, Syphilis, Hepatitis B, I wonder if I need to test for Herpes 2 separately but the only thing doctors have found so far, has to do with the liquid that comes out of my urethra:
• Diplococcus gram negative extracellular.
• Coccobacillus gram negatives.
• Coccos gram positives.
Doctor said it could be indicative of gonorrhea, but I never had urethral discharge, nonetheless the order me with doxycycline 100mg, for 20 days, which didn’t seem to have helped at all.
Another thing I remember is that a month after the unprotected contact, I had a stiff neck and a sore throat that would not go away, lasted about a month, then never came back, only the headaches remain.
I was wondering if anyone out there has had any similar symptoms and if they have discovered what it was, my only symptoms right now, after 13 months, are the slight but annoying headaches almost every day and pain in my hands.
Any info would help me out a lot.","October 18, 2015 at 10:32 am",2 Replies,"About Daniel82

We thank our member Nancy, the wife of a man who fell ill with a rare and life-threatening neurological disorder, for sharing her story. In the video, Nancy describes how she joined Inspire and discovered information and support that helped her find treatment for her husband. We are grateful also to those members who helped inform Nancy and lift her spirits.

dolmas,https://www.inspire.com/m/dolmas/,"Hey guys,

I'm a male that got diagnosed with HPV via urethral swab. I tested positive for HPV-89.My doctor told me that this strain is a low risk strain and that it hasn't been shown to produce genital warts. So I should act like I'm not infected.He also stated that after a couple of years my body will fight the virus off.
All credible medical sites (NHS,cancerresearch,cdc etc) state that HPV goes away completely.
The ONLY sites that state that HPV lies dormant are usually posters on medcheck and other health related sites.
So what should I believe?

graul,https://www.inspire.com/m/graul/,"I have been living with the virus for years. The outbreaks around the mouth. I finally have prevented the cold sores/fever blisters from popping out around my lips. As soon as I feel the symptoms of an attack I take a very common medicine that has been around for over 50 yrs. (not meant for the prevention of the virus) but it works. I haven't had an outbreak for years. Although I feel one coming sometimes 3-5 times a year, I take this medicine and it stops the outbreaks...No cold sores or blisters. This does not cure the virus but it does stop from having cold sores. I have been testing it for years and if I feel an attack coming and don't take this medicine I will have cold sores or about 7-14 days. But when I take the medicine I can feel it working inside of me and no cold sores. I have been trying to get in touch with pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field with no avail. I pay $5.00 for this medicine and it will help me through for about 2 years of outbreaks. That's less than .40 cents a month I have to pay. I now feel I can live with this terrible virus since I have now found a way of preventing the sores to come out and go about my life not feeling embarrassed going about with sores on my lip. The way this medicine works is that it attacks the virus in another way everyone else in pharmaceutics is attacking it. My mother was a nurse and herbalist in Costa Rica and she always treated me and saw the virus attacking the human body and immune system differently. She was right. I need to have the experts in this field contact me. There are millions of people who would benefit from this. Not only it is cheap to get (over the counter), it is safe for kids and adults, but also it has been around for many many years and has already been tested as a very safe product to take. If there's anyone out there that can give me some advice to who I can contact please let me know.","August 27, 2013 at 10:16 am",17 Replies,"About graul

madmax33,https://www.inspire.com/m/madmax33/,"Hi. Thought I would post here and hope to get some Advice of what to do next. This is just eating me up when I have a multitude of chronic health issues. (just one more not taken care of) First Let me say, I have lousy Insurance. Cannot seem to get proper Medical care for insurance reasons and area I live in. (I am trying to move but impossible right now with how Sick I am) I need Help! Please just dont drop me a note and tell me to seek out a other DR. I would not post here and ask for help, as you can see , referral take a long time, and dealing with the insurance, and have done that now three times! I live in a rural area with horrible medical care as it is. If the Dr you got referred to, does nothing, OK this leaves you hanging out on a limb, of what they pay for. I also am on a fixed income . Now to get to the issue. I am 59. , Had a Complete Histro at the age of 30. Due to Stage 1V pap, cancer cells. Was told I needed a pap every year after this. Moved to this area over 25 yrs ago. No Drs would do Paps on me, when I asked, as I kept being told, I did not need one! Forward. In 2010, downhill with many health issues. Finally a OB GYN, decides to do a Pap/HPV test. Pap came back abnormal and HPV Positive. Well, Told then at 55, Don't need to worry about it at my age, Only younger woman of child bearing age need to worry about it. I did not even know what HPV was at this time. I was very sick in 2010, weight loss, Thyroid Hashimotos, and had Bile Duc surgery. (I have a multitude of health problems, autoimmune and still feel I have not been diagnosed correctly as of today) My gastro, Dr back in 2010, about dropped his glassed off his face back in 2010, and told me this was a issue that needed addressed ASAP. He obviously was concerned and I am sure from the state of health I have been in. (a Great Dr) Ok it has taken up to 2014 with the crappy insurance , referrals and finding a other Dr to re due a pap again (I have been more informed what this means) He does just a pap, no HPV test. This is even after I go in and bring my past records, letting him know my concerns over this HPV. Informing him, Hystro due to cancer, and this is Why I am there. Pap comes back normal. So my daughter brings me back in, and demands i get a Pap, HPV test. (now everything I read and trying to educate myself on this, seems any good Gyno Dr does both of this test). So I wonder why he avoids even checking for HPV? So he does the pap again for HPV. Comes back High Risk HPV. I get copies of my records. he also does Biopsy's on the Vulva, inside and out? thinks he sees abnormalties. Well this has me really worried. Ok I am left hanging again!!! None of this makes any sense to me at all, other then I feel like I am getting the most horrible care and again, my research I am finding this is not normal protocol, for some one of my age, past cancer, and having HPV for this long and no further testing or treatments? The HPV states High risk, I know there are 18 strains which can cause cancer. Two of these are the most common. They test for the Two only with the Pap smear. I called as they keep Paps for a long time. I asked the nurse to talk to the Dr , to see if they could check the other 16 stains as I was worried. No he refused. Also let me say, I am almost a 100% European , have my own DNA, which I have been researching. Well, I am high Risk for Cancer genetically I have found out. I seem to have more rare mutations in general which are not the common on anything which are looked for as common, for cancers, disease, risk etc.
Now on the biopsy's, these took over 6 weeks. Through speaking with the nurses at that time , The pathologist had to discuss matters with the Dr. So of course this had me very worried. I am thinking cancer cancer cancer! The conversations are between the pathologist and Dr, and never discussed with me. A other reason to be concerned, Talk about not being informed! (how can it be accurate if a Dr does not seem to care?) My test results showed, No prior Pap on the report? Also showed no History of Cancer, no Hystro, Also did not state Past HPV? So what did they talk about? How do I know this Dr gave him any of this important information over the phone? So anyways, forward, A bunch of medical terms on this report (dont have in front of me) with conditions on these biopsys? None make sense to me. Dr will see me in a yr! This Dr did not have me come in. nurses gave me the info, so I requested the results be mailed to me. So again, on the search again for a other OB Dr. Last month found one out of this area. Referred to me by a Urologist office, where the Woman nurse told me I needed to get in! Ok I got in. seen this new Dr. I told the Dr. my concerns. Had my test with me. He did a Pelvic. Said he would do a other HPV/Pap in 6 months. Ok, Now I feel like I am lousing my mind and need clarification on this , why I am here on this board! This Dr told me , I am worrying about Nothing!! HPV is nothing and nothing to worry about at all!! No concern what so ever and I am making a big deal out of nothing! Need to forget it? This is a nightmare and I am in disbelief over this. I cant help but feel it is not only a lack of neglect over the insurance I have. I also feel These Drs are covering other Drs who have done nothing with this and dont care if It could possible be cancer, spread to cancer. etc etc ! Anything I have read, this is not standard of care or Protocol, for a Positive HPV, especially considered High Risk. I also have read, if this could be a cancer, these types of cancer can be very slow growing! So what can I do or am I worrying about nothing? (Not only for peace of mind, I am worried as I have fatigue so bad, heart problems, breathing problems, SOB, etc , no energy, Chronic pain and going down hill. I hope this is not the culprit of some cancer which has spread? I am tired and making all this effort of trying to be my own activist and staying on top of my health, what can I do if Drs are not doing anything? I am hoping for some clarification, of what should be done? What is the normal protocol, what to expect, and if I need to worry and get other answers some where else somehow.","August 19, 2015 at 5:04 am",2 Replies,"About madmax33

Scared36,https://www.inspire.com/m/Scared36/,I discovered on 7/13/15 that wife had unprotected sex with another man on 7/9/15. This has been a devastating revelation to say the least. I am now extremely concerned about the possibility of contraction of an STI from her. As I work in a lab I have already tested myself for GC and Chlamydia and both are negative. I have since begun to discover very small red bumps on the head of my penis. They are slightly painful but only intermittently. My question is now this. Is it possible for her to have contracted herpes from this individual and could it be possible that she has now passed it to me given the very short time frame that has now elapsed? I'm freaking out about this because herpes is incurable and there is plenty of stigma attached to it. As I have only had 2 sex partners in my life I do not believe that this could be from the previous partner that was 13 years ago (yes i was a late bloomer).,"August 15, 2015 at 6:05 pm",6 Replies,"About Scared36

So earlier I posted wondering if my symptoms were HSV2, and they were. I was just diagnosed about an hour ago so I might still be in shock. I don't know if I should tell the guy or not. My doctor said that he for sure has herpes and gave it to me, since my symptoms are bad, reflecting an initial outbreak. He also said that the guy I was with can't really be tested because he is probably asymptomatic or something. I'm guessing he didn't even know he had it in the first place, but I'm not sure if I can/should tell him. I just don't want him to go on and infect other people because I would hate to have someone go though what I am right now.

I need some suggestions on next steps. When/who should I tell? I want to keep it all a big secret but I don't want him to keep passing it around. Also, how the hell do you even have this conversation with anyone??? Please help me out here.","July 3, 2015 at 12:18 pm",10 Replies,"About alliecat44

Dejavudu,https://www.inspire.com/m/Dejavudu/,"Please help . I have not seen this topic covered anywhere else.

My girlfriend just got out of the hospital due to problems with immune deficiency and low blood pressure. She had the flu for a few days prior to the following events. In the middle of the night she went to use the restroom and passed out, falling and cutting her head. I took her to the hospital where she remained for 7 days getting tests including bloodwork and bone marrow samples. She has long had low white blood cell counts and low blood pressure.They gave her Vitamin B12 shots which seemed to bring her blood pressure back to 110 / 65 and her white blood cell count to 2.8 (her personal best is 3.1 and they say she should be at 3.8).

She has had HSV1 for 4 years. She has been tested and was negative for HSV2.

I was just tested and diagnosed as positive for HSV2. Like many, I had no idea until this week I had it and have never had an outbreak.

Her doctor has advised her not to continue a sexual relationship with me. We are both completely broken hearted. They say due to her immune deficiency, exposure to HSV 2 could result in very nasty outbreaks. Even worse, it could overtax her immune system, possibly leaving her at risk for even deadly outbreaks of other diseases.

Please share with me any experience you may be aware of. Or even better , point me to the right doctor with expertise in infectious disease, immune deficiency, HSV2 and hematology. We live in South Florida But we could potentially travel if there were a better place.

I understand that the University of Miami has expertise and a Center of Excellence in MDS ( Myelodysplastic syndromes ) that could be relevant expertise because it centers on bone marrow.

Again, thank you for your attention and help. My girlfriend and I are absolutely devastated at facing ending our relationship but the risk of her life being threatened seems to leave us no choice. Help, please.","July 12, 2015 at 4:21 pm",4 Replies,"About Dejavudu

I have HSV2. Recently I had joint paints on my knees, waists, ankles etc. I went to a Rheumatologist and he said I don't have Arthritis and I don't have inflammations or swollen. Also they could not see Arthritis signs in the xRay and Ultrasounds Scans. I am confused, Can herpes create this mild pain in my joints and stiffed mild fingers that sometimes make it unconformable to walk? Anyone has experience anything like it?

Thanks,

alliecat44,https://www.inspire.com/m/alliecat44/,"Hi everyone,

I was just wondering if anyone had any tips for me. I'm having my first outbreak of HSV2 (GH) and it is horrible!! I can't eat because I can't go to the bathroom, and even walking around is hard! It's also my time of the month so keeping dry down there is next to impossible.

I've read that using a hairdryer on cool helps, and when I tried it did make a difference for a bit. I've been soaking in the bathtub but even that is painful sometimes. My doctor gave me lidocaine to help with the pain but the lesions are killing me!

If anyone has some ideas that will help speed up the healing or some little tips to help with the outbreak it would be appreciated. Also, I'm curious as to how long this lasts?","July 4, 2015 at 3:50 pm",2 Replies,"About alliecat44

alliecat44,https://www.inspire.com/m/alliecat44/,"Hello everyone,
I'm looking for some help or some answers because I am kind of freaking out. I recently had sex with a friend of mine and we didn't use protection. I've done that once before and nothing bad came of it. I noticed that there were some changes happening after though. Two days later my vagina was really itchy, and then in a bit it started to get swollen with a lot of discharge happening. I didn't know what to do, so instead I just kind of ignored it. Now I can see four or five spots, three of which are small with white centers (one burst), and the other two are just red bumps (one of them is almost gone). There was little bleeding but A LOT of pain. Its hard to go to the bathroom at all. At night the burning feeling is so bad I can't really sleep. Then last night I guess I must have scratched or something and then touched my eyelid because today there is a big bump over it!! Also, my lymph nodes by my hips are painful and pretty swollen. The only difference between the symptoms I've read about online and the ones I have is that my blisters haven't scabbed over at all, and there aren't that many of them. I'm really worried now, can someone tell me for sure if this is HSV2? Or if there is anything else it can be??? I'm really starting to lose hope. I'm getting tested today but I'm not sure how long it will take to get an answer.
Also, if these are the symptoms and I do have it, did I for sure get it from the guy? Or was it me the whole time? Please help ASAP!!!!","July 3, 2015 at 8:19 am",1 Reply,"About alliecat44

ScaredLost888,https://www.inspire.com/m/ScaredLost888/,"Hello, I was just diagnosed with herpes after having my first, and very severe, outbreak a couple of weeks ago. My doctor says I was almost certainly infected by my new partner, who apparently did not know he had herpes. I told him in a non-accusatory way, and he repeatedly said he would be there for me 100% and said we would tackle this together. But then once the test results came back and confirmed my doctor's initial diagnosis, he is pulling away and now he is not answering my calls or text messages, and I'm afraid he is going to leave me if he hasn't already. This is such a mean thing to do to someone under any circumstance, but right after he knows he was the one to give me this, it's remarkably cold-hearted. I know this is a big bad bit of news to find out for himself, and I've been understanding on this, but it still doesn't excuse his behavior.

I was already feeling scared and overwhelmed about everything, but knowing that partner was going to be there with me on this, I felt a little bit of comfort. We haven't known each other very long--couple of months--but we had gotten relatively serious quickly and he said he was clean before we had sex. Now with him probably gone or at the very least treating me so horribly I should leave him, I'm feeling so much more scared and alone. I can't even imagine dating anyone at this point. I've sort of resigned myself to a life of no intimacy, at least for the foreseeable future.

Any advice or thoughts anyone has would be much appreciated. I haven't felt like myself since this happened. I feel like I'm living out a bad Lifetime movie.","November 16, 2014 at 10:38 am",4 Replies,"About ScaredLost888

sweetsage,https://www.inspire.com/m/sweetsage/,"I'm just coming to terms with my own HSV2 diagnosis which I received only a couple of months ago. I'm in college and all I needed on top of a heavy school load was an STI. I was experiencing some discomfort during Thanksgiving break and I mentioned it to my mom and she was the one who asked me ""is it herpes, maybe?"" Well you can imagine how that went over: I ran to my room, hit up Google, and started scaring the wits out of myself. It was like I would rather have had the plague than have herpes and top it off have my mom know that I was having sex--granted I had only ever had sex twice. I grew up in a fairly liberal home but we never talked about sex. Sex prevention was the only sex education we were given at school, so how is it that we are so surprised that so many people are infected with STI's? Our society shames individuals who, from at a young age, don't learn the real facts about safe sex then they are sent into the ""Wide World"" with nothing but a naive sense of invincibility and then BOOM! Your whole life is changed in an instant and society thinks you're reckless, dirty, slut, etc., etc...

When I got my diagnosis, I tried so hard to remain cool and collected while my brain was in a whorl of accusations at myself--""nobody is ever going to love you!"" ""you're not worthy."" ""might as well give up now..."" My doctor looked at me with the nicest and least judgmental look on her face, handed me a box of tissues, and gave me the facts: tell your partners, reduce stress, find what treatment option works best for you.

I went home and broke down crying when got to my room and my mom immediately knew what is was about. She held me and told me that this does not define me. This is not who I am, it is a part of me, but it will not limit my own self worth. She told me another thing as well: We as individual people are all on our own journeys. Each one is different and each one has its own lessons to be learned. This is our journey. Those who accept us for who we are are the people that deserve our love and those are the people worth spending the rest of our lives with--not the people who buy into the stigmas surrounding STI/STDs. I'm a stronger person now that I realize that I don't have the word HERPES stamped across my forehead as I walk across campus. I decide who I am and so can you. We are strong and we deserve love, especially from ourselves. Hugs!","February 21, 2015 at 11:05 pm",13 Replies,"About sweetsage

I am pleased to announced that we have just published, for the third year running, Experts by Experience 2015: A compilation of patients’ stories, a new special report developed in partnership with Stanford Medicine.

Experts by Experience compiles a year’s worth of monthly columns written by patients and caregivers for Stanford Medicine’s Scope medical blog. I encourage you to read and share the stories of these 12 patients.

In the collection’s foreword, psychologist Ben Miller said:

“Our stories are our power. In order to bring about change in healthcare to create the patient-centered system we all want, not the system we have, there must be a collective; there must be a gathering of patients together, with data, to make a case that change is needed and change is inevitable.”

I couldn’t agree more. We are grateful to Stanford Medicine, to our partners, and to you: the nearly 600,000 members who Inspire us all.

skypeezhang,https://www.inspire.com/m/skypeezhang/,"What are the frequently asked adenomyosis questions? Let’s take a look at it.
What is adenomyosis?
Adenomyosis is a non-cancerous condition in which the cells of the endometrium grow into the muscular walls of the uterus. Clinically, its symptoms are painful menses, irregular period and infertility.
The types that adenomyosis have
Adenomyosis can be classified into focal and diffuse two types. The diffuse type occurs when the cells of the endometrium grow into the whole muscular walls (at different place and in different degree), while the focal type commonly has the ectopic endometrium in some walls (it looks like fibroids). In ultrasonic wave, the echo of diffuse type is uneven.
Are the fibroid and the adenomyosis the same thing?
The two are different conditions. Even the symptoms of the two are same – resulting in large uterus. But there are also differences. For adenomyosis women, the enlarged uterus can shrink and grow with the period while the fibroid has no such character. .Fibroid is a lesion that happen the muscular walls of the uterus. It is a ball-shaped condition. Therefore, it commonly is taken tumor. In fact, it isn’t a tumor. As for the adenomyosis, it is a benign tumor.
What is the cause of adenomyosis?
The causes of adenomyosis still are unknown. But two theories are widely accepted. Injures caused by repeatedly pregnancy and delivery is the first but also is the major reason. The other one is disorder on ovaries.
What are the typical symptoms of adenomyosis?
Adenomyosis patients usually can experience enlarged uterus, harden uterus, painful menses, heavy menses and so on. What’s more, compared with normal days, uterus before period is larger.
How to cure the adenomyosis?
Adenomyosis can be cured by surgery and medication two ways. Hysterectomy and Myometrium electric coagulation are great choice. Medication can be divided into western medicine and herbal medicine. If you are a fan of western medicine, GnRHa and birth control pills are good choice. If you like a safer treatment, herbal medicine Fuyan pill would be a good choice.","February 6, 2015 at 3:56 am",0 Replies,"About skypeezhang

Beaisme,https://www.inspire.com/m/Beaisme/,"It was diagnosed with herpes today.i am a 49 year old single woman. I had been dating a man for 8 months. We did not use condoms. 2 weeks ago after the last time we had sex, the day after, I noticed pain in my genital area that got worse. After a few days I noticed the lesions. I was worried, but was on my way on vacation. I was finally able to get an appointment today and was told it was herpes, although I am still waiting on the blood tests to confirm. I did not have any other symptoms, swollen glands, flu like, etc. my doctor told me not to assume it was my current partner as it could have lied dormant for years. I have been under enormous stress recently which could have brought it on.

I am devastated but trying to remain positive. I feel alone, although I have read the statistics and the comments here and realize that it is not so uncommon, but I can't get past the stigma that I think I will feel. I know it's not a reflection on me as a person, but it is hard to come to grips with this.

deanm,https://www.inspire.com/m/deanm/,"I am a male that has had a genital hpv infection for 15 years. My immune system is very good other than the fact I cannot get rid of my gw's. I workout, play sports, eat healthy and have not had the flu or even a cold for many years. I literally have hundreds of very tiny warts that itch during the day and when I'm sleeping which wakes me up at night. I have seen multiple doctors and most have said they look like very tiny warts (almost microscopic) but are too small to treat since any of the treatments used would ruin healthy surrounding skin. Two docs even said not worry since ""I look like a healthy person"" and they should clear on their own. That was 15 years ago. Some docs think its from another type of genital hpv other than 6 or 11. This is so frustrating and I am now in my 40s. I have seen over 8 doctors. I finally went to see a dermatologist and he took a biopsy on one of the wart clusters. The diagnosis came back as benign keratosis however he said since it was on the penis that it was due to an hpv infection. He told me no treatment was needed and to go on with my life. What does that mean??? Easier said than done especially when nothing relieves the itching. Can't remember when I've had a good nights sleep. I've only found 2 documented cases on medical journals where someone else was diagnosed with the same condition. I guess I'm am the 3rd person ever with this condition.

1. Does anyone have a similar experience such as mine?
2. Does this mean I am no longer contagious since no HPV was found even though I still have hundreds of warts (bumps) on my penis
Any suggestions on how to treat this?

We are the team behind this site. We feel very fortunate to be able to work on a project that can make a real difference in helping people to live their lives happily.

Inspire was created in 2005 by a group of friends. We were each dealing with important medical issues in our families, and we found that while the Internet was a useful source for authoritative medical information, it was not a safe, welcoming place for us to find support.

We created Inspire to change all that. We envisioned a place where we as patients, caregivers, family and friends could support one another, and where we could do so in a safe, secure, privacy-protected environment.

We are dedicated to building the best online health communities possible. Like our community members, all of us have faced health challenges of our own - and we know from personal experience how valuable the support and encouragement of others can be.

Our tagline, 'Together We're Better', is at the heart of what we do."

Kena,https://www.inspire.com/m/Kena/,"For about 15 years, I have been getting sores on my lips. I was told various things - impetigo, dry lips, acne, and finally cold sores. My doctor gave me a prescription last year for valacyclovir 1 gram tablets, take 1-3 daily prn. He said I could take half a pill daily when not in a flare up to keep it at bay. When I would feel the tingling start, I would take half a pill daily, some times that would knock it right out, and sometimes I would have to increase to a whole tablet if sores started to develop. I use it in conjunction with an OTC ointment to help keep the sores from weeping too much.

In late August, I started feeling the familiar tingle, so I started treating it. I got to a point where, for the first time, I was taking a whole pill breakfast, lunch, and dinner just to keep my whole mouth from turning into a giant, nasty, bloody, pus-soaked mess. It took nearly a month to wipe it out.

Now, I have another flare up!

It seems like external forces can trigger an out-break. I was wearing a surgical mask on Wednesday, and could feel it rubbing where I usually feel the first tingle, and sure enough, on Thursday morning I had a sore starting up.

I don't know that the pill is helping - it didn't seem to do anything last time. And why is it flaring up so frequently? Can the anti-viral become ineffective so fast? Is this maybe not a cold sore? Has anyone dealt with this?","October 11, 2014 at 9:21 pm",2 Replies,"About Kena

Blessed4sure,https://www.inspire.com/m/Blessed4sure/,"I'm a 64 year old young Grandmother recently remarried and just had my first ever abnormal pap with diagnosed HPV. I have been always been very active and healthy . Being divorced and celibate for nearly 15 years the news of being HPV positive came as a total shocker. I have ASCUS cells and CIN 1 dysplasia. I Recently had the Leep procedure. At the 3 month follow up pap showed abnormal cells yet again but no dysplasia. In 3 months ( end of Nov) I'll have a pap with the ECC procedure. I must say I had no idea what a beast this virus is. Rather than being a victim I am proactive trying to educate myself on what I need to be doing to stay on top of this nasty deadly virus. I started taking AHCC so at my next 3 month pap I'll have been on AHCC a little over 2 months. My question is should my husband be using condoms when we have sex at this point ? I am very encouraged at what I've read so far on AHCC. My husband shows no signs of the virus maybe just a carrier. His health history is exceptionally good. At 64 and now HPV positive I realize the risks for cervical, anal and oral cancer go up tremendously for me. I would appreciate any advise for Seniors who are newly diagnosed HPV positive. At the moment I know it is imperative I boost up my immune system ASAP . Praying the AHCC along with eating healthier and working out halts this virus.... Staying Positive Too!!

Karma976,https://www.inspire.com/m/Karma976/,"After almost 2 years of celibacy, I met a new man and eventually had sex with a condom. Two days later, I got a yeast infection and treated it with OTC meds. After a few days, the infection seemed cleared up but I was still experiencing some itching and inflammation. I attributed it to irritation from the treatment plus friction (clothing, drying off after the shower, wiping post-bathroom, etc.). I went to see a nurse practitioner just to make sure. She confirmed no yeast, but did an HSV test due to seeing three ""lesions"".

I wasn't expecting anything like this and couldn't wrap my head around it (I'm 37 and have never had an STI). When I asked if that's what it looked like, she avoided answering and said herpes can present differently. I didn't have the kind of pain I've read about, nor did I notice blisters or the crusting I've read about. When I got home I looked myself and it looked like almost pin pricks, and I assumed it was small tears from friction in a dry area (the OTC yeast infection medication dried out that entire area). The pin pricks/lesions were in an area that I couldn't see would come in direct skin-to-skin contact with my partner.

The nurse put me on an anti-viral just in case and gave me a steroid ointment to help with the swelling/inflammation. One day after taking the anti-virals, my lymph nodes in my groin felt swollen and tender for less than a day. I feel back to my normal self (aside from my constant anxiety and accompanying stomachache). I may not get my results until mid- to late- this week. As days have passed, I've tried coming to terms with a positive diagnosis. Despite knowing this is a common skin condition, and not indicative of my worth as a person, I am having a hard time not viewing myself as ""less than"" or ""tainted"".

cancancer,https://www.inspire.com/m/cancancer/,"So I had the big tumor cut out of my butt cheek. They took a Porterhouse Steak sized portion of my left Gluteus Maximus, leaving me feeling rather ""half-assed"". BUTT, and that's a pretty big butt, I have a bigger cheek on the side of the surgery than on the side that's just been atrophying and shrinking from age and the inactivity that follows major surgery. I'd be getting a fat-ass from all the lying around, but I'm too nauseated from the chemo.

I really don't intend to say yes to radiation again.

I feel that Essiac tea helped my surgeon get the wonderful margins and good results from my surgery. So the swelling butt cheek is really bothersome. The surgical drain fell out too soon. Now I'm wearing a pigtail drain-in-the ass to relieve the enormous seroma (bloody fluid-filled sac) between my skin and my wounded glute. Essiac Tea can be found online from SwansonVitamin.com... are we allowed to mention websites that sell stuff?

Essiac Tea, do your own research, is said to pull in all the tentacles a tumor sends out, making the tumor initially larger, but then ultimately destroying the whole tumor. I am going to make more Essiac tea and keep taking it, because I have five more tumors to fight and no guarantee the chemo and nausea, constipation and diarrhea are going to result in a cure. In fact, they only suggest I'll survive longer with cancer, than if I had no treatment.

So I'm planning my own, half-assed treatment, in addition to theirs, and I'm taking what I can keep down during the second week after each treatment, because I'm fairly intolerant of many of my usual supplements during the first week... and vomiting by day three, for a couple of days. They said I wouldn't vomit or lose my hair. My hair is thinning faster than my muscles are wasting. But it's LONG and curly, so I don't care. It'll fill in when the treatment stops. I won't lose it all. I'm finally taking the advice of my friends with ethnic hair. I'm braiding it at night, to keep it from tangling. The detanglind makes it fall out. Not gonna do it. Last night I braided the hair before bed and woke up tangle free. Just had to spritz and scrunch it and it was great. I'm gonna save so much on conditioner!

My illustrator and I are continuing to work on bringing you all a dynamically entertaining book, very soon. And that's another reason I've been AWOL from Inspire so long. I do love and miss you all and will try to catch up soon.

PM me if you want my FB or email... because I'm certainly always open to adding friends and ... I update on that site almost daily. And then i can keep track of you, too... like a stalker... only... a benign one. Not a malignant or malevolent stalker.

Okay.... years into the cancer ""trip"", I think I need to preface the below remarks with a little about who I ""was"" before cancer. An actress, a writer, an artist, a poet or songwriter on occasion... and the mother of four adult children, all working in the arts. One is a fashion designer, two are actress/singer/dancers/writers, and my only son is a composer, arranger, songwriter, and recording engineer. We all live in L.A. and are in varying stages of achieving our biggest dreams. I am the farthest from a goal, but then, for decades, I'd thought I was doing all right, writing big dramas for big churches, acting in them, directing some, and designing kitchens and baths or drawing portraits on commission, sometimes hiring my kids to help draw during the Christmas rush. I was learning the craft of screenwriting with an eye to producing my own films. I had enrolled in film school and moved to Hollywood, just prior to learning I had cancer.

I was diagnosed with cancer on February 2, 2010. It was a malignant neoplasm of the anal canal. The tumor is an adenocarcinoma. I believe that makes it a colorectal cancer, rather than anal cancer, but that's unclear. I read on the Internet that ""Anal Cancer"" is always squamous cell carcinoma"" and... mine wasn't. I also read that squamous cell carcinoma is related to HPV and... adenocarcinoma isn't. But... I read conflicting reports, so I'm not sure what's accurate.

I had chemo and radiation to shrink and kill the tumor and the cancer in the two nearby lymph nodes. When they removed my anus and lymph nodes, the surgeons said they got ""clean margins."" A permanent colostomy was performed. And my ovaries were removed, as a precaution because cancer could hide there. I wasn't menopausal before the radiation but I have been, since. I had unbearable hot flashes and night sweats for several months, but those seem to have subsided. They were the least of my difficulties, though. I had several complications after the surgery. There probably isn't room to list them here, and I haven't the time or inclination to write about them. But they delayed the start of my chemo, and hand and foot syndrome occasioned a one month break from that treatment. I finished it, finally and got the port removed before I knew the PET-CT results. There was a new tumor in a lymph node. It was impeding my kidney from draining and my intestines from emptying. A surgery removed the tumor and repaired the damage. I have had a couple of stents in the affected ureter, and am undergoing chemotherapy to kill off any lurking cancer cells."

JLB211,https://www.inspire.com/m/JLB211/,"Hello Everyone. I was diagnosed with HSV-2 a little over a year ago. It was DEVASTATING when I first found out. I thought my life was over. However, as time passed and I became more educated, I realized that having herpes sucked but did NOT have to define my life. I have dated a few guys who were okay with it. I have also been rejected because of it, which is so very hurtful. I am on daily suppressive therapy and have not had an outbreak since that first one. Sometimes, I even forget I have it. But a few weeks ago I met a new guy. I broke the news to him about a week ago and told him that I completely understood if he couldn't handle it and just asked that he not drag it on. At first, he was really sweet and said it was just a bump in the road and he only needed some time to get comfortable with it. Then yesterday, out of the blue, I get a text saying he can't stop thinking about it and he was terrified of catching it and then being stuck with it if we didn't work out. I have tried explaining to him that the stigma attached to herpes is way worse than the reality of having it. That I take daily medication, do not have outbreaks, and that the chances are so very slim that he will ever get it. I just don't know what else to do to make him feel better about the situation. He says this is the only thing keeping him from wanting to pursue things further, and I'm having a hard time accepting that. Does anyone have any advice?","July 14, 2014 at 3:34 pm",4 Replies,"About JLB211

Fredo101,https://www.inspire.com/m/Fredo101/,"Hey everyone,

This is Fredo from ASHA & NCCC. Over the summer I posted that we're a partner with the University of California, San Francisco on a research project to develop a cervical cancer screening educational tool for women. There are additional focus group opportunities available in the Northern California area this fall that we want to let you know about.

The researchers are looking to speak with women in California who would be willing to participate in focus groups and interviews about their opinions and experiences on this topic. Participants in the focus groups receive $50. Eligible women for this study are:

-between the ages of 21-30 years old
-have had a Pap test

Women in Northern California, specifically the San Francisco Bay area, are especially encouraged to respond. These focus groups are limited in size so if you (or someone you know) is interested or would like more information, please contact us at info@ashasexualhealth.org.

GreyKat,https://www.inspire.com/m/GreyKat/,"After 13 years of normal Pap smears, my most recent test came back abnormal. At the awkward age of 28 -- two years too old for the vaccine, two years to young for the doctors to start testing unprompted -- I tested positive for HPV, the human papillomavirus. My doctor confirmed with a colposcopy that I do in fact have abnormal cells on the anterior of my cervix. She performed a biopsy (or three) and now I await to see where I stand. The not-knowing is always the hardest. I can't help but feel that this was something DONE to me, not something that happened to me -- something GIVEN, not acquired. I'm filled with anger and angst at times. I've done some reading and I realize that I could have got it from any of the three sexual partners I've had in my life, including that cheating dog of an ex AND/OR my loving and supportive husband. But that knowledge doesn't make me feel better. In fact, knowing that, apart from a vaccine I never sought, there is just about no way to prevent HPV and that just about everyone has the virus just makes me angrier. Because now my body is a loaded gun and it's pointed at myself and I'm just waiting to find out if it's going to go off or not, or maybe more accurately if it's going to go off now or later. My doctor tried to reassure me that she didn't see any dysplasia or cancer, but diminishing the seriousness of the test did not comfort me. If it's not serious, we wouldn't be here, would we? My mother was equally dismissive. After I explained to her what HPV is and what the biopsy could show, she said, ""Chin up, it could be anything."" What? I know she doesn't understand and was just trying to be cheerful and optimistic, but it felt very dismissive. I'm not being melodramatic or seeking pity. But I am scared and I am angry and I just want to know more and know what happens next. If you're in the same boat or have sailed that sea, please reach your oar out to me.","June 18, 2014 at 10:05 pm",25 Replies,"About GreyKat

Jax88,https://www.inspire.com/m/Jax88/,"Hi. I have been reading the posts from others and have found them to be interesting and informative.
Late in may I was engaged in sexual activity with a man of unknown std status. Basically he fingered my vagina and we kissed while sitting in a car. At one point he unzipped and I briefly fondled his dry flaccid penis, which to my recollection had no lesions. Immediately after, I am certain that the same hand I used to touch him, was used to stimulate myself. Of course I am extremely anxious over this incident as I have been experiencing what seems like possible pre outbreak and other symptoms. What fuels my anxiety is the uncertainly; the more I read about HSV/genital heroes the more I realize how complex this virus is. I realize that it can present in a multitude of ways or sometimes not at all. Because of my emotional angst and distress over this, I feel I can't trust what I see or feel--I am constantly checking for signs and am not sure what's what anymore. It's very upsetting.
So. I had std tests done and all came back negative. I had a blood test done, igg and I was told that it was non reactive. Since the testing was done at three weeks post exposure I am treating it like a baseline. I have a req to get another blood test done so that I might have a better understanding of what is going on, now that it is about 31/2 months post exposure (Even though the doctor suggested that another test might make things more confusing for me if it comes back positive-- but I think it will help...).
What I would like some feedback on is in regards to the potential risks associated with the situation described above.
How likely is it to transmit the virus--genital herpes--via genital hand genital transmission?","September 7, 2014 at 10:50 pm",0 Replies,"About Jax88

Dreddge,https://www.inspire.com/m/Dreddge/,"I'm 31 and have had unprotected vaginal sex twice in the last year, and unprotected oral sex several times.

I had routine blood work done last week and my doctor decided to test me for hsv for the first time ever.

I had igG test done at warde labs. I tested an incredibly high 29.40 for hsv1 which I knew I had due to the occasional cold sore. I tested 1.32 for hsv2.

Obviously I was shocked. Given my history and the fact that I've never had a single symptom of genital herpes.
Neither of my past sexual partners are positive.

I did my research and called the Dr back and requested a western blot test. They said that the WB was only for HIV, and to just assume I'm positive until my next visit. Obviously I'm upset by this response. I would like to hear some opinions on this.

Would the exceptionally high hsv1 result affect the hsv2 result? This is a very low positive.

I assume it is exceptionally rare to pass hsv2 from a woman's mouth to my penis. Especially if there are no visible sites. If there were I would not have allowed her to go near it.","August 5, 2014 at 4:40 pm",1 Reply,"About Dreddge

ConcernedAsAlways,https://www.inspire.com/m/ConcernedAsAlways/,"Hi guys, thanks for taking the time to read my story, I very much appreciate it.

I began worrying about having herpes was after a sexual encounter with an ex that happened almost 4 weeks ago. Making things even more difficult, I suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder and once I become obsessively worried about something it can be very, very difficult for me to move on and get over it.

Every time I have an itch ""down there""...I worry. Every time I go to the bathroom, I feel the need to inspect every inch and make sure there are no suspicious ""spots"". I should add that I have talked to many doctors, both online and in person, about this topic. I have taken numerous pictures of spots that I feared could be herpes...they were all found not to be. Even though I feel temporarily reassured when this happens...the fear always comes back. I want, actually I need, closure on this topic for my own well being. Furthermore, this encounter that I am concerned about took place when my current girlfriend and I were on a ""break""...and I am petrified of passing anything along to her. We have not slept together since I began worrying about herpes. We aren't officially back together yet and this is one of the main things holding me back.


So, I guess I wanted to know your suggestion as to how I could lay this topic to rest once and for all. I have read extensively about blood testing for herpes and its flaws. However, it seems as though the only flawed test is the IgM blood test, which gives false positives constantly. Since I know I am positive for HSV-1, this would surely not be a good idea in my situation. However, as I understand it, the IgG test is very accurate and reliable in the proper context, and it can accurately distinguish between HSV 1 & 2. The most notable draw back on this type of test is time, and It has been almost 5 weeks for me, but I have read it can take up to 12 to be completely accurate.

I have seen several ""spots"" on my penis that had caused me concern, but had them checked out by my family doctor as well as several doctors online..none of them said any of the spots were suggestive of a herpes infection.


In a nutshell, I am looking for what you think would be the best option for me at this point? Should I get an IgG test now and then retest after 12 weeks? Would an IgG test NOW be conclusive? Or do I have to wait? Are there any other options that could give me a definitive answer that I dont know about? Any advice will be extremely appreciated as every day seems to be a struggle worrying about this so intensely.

Thanks so much.","August 12, 2014 at 3:18 pm",1 Reply,"About ConcernedAsAlways

Okay.... years into the cancer ""trip"", I think I need to preface the below remarks with a little about who I ""was"" before cancer. An actress, a writer, an artist, a poet or songwriter on occasion... and the mother of four adult children, all working in the arts. One is a fashion designer, two are actress/singer/dancers/writers, and my only son is a composer, arranger, songwriter, and recording engineer. We all live in L.A. and are in varying stages of achieving our biggest dreams. I am the farthest from a goal, but then, for decades, I'd thought I was doing all right, writing big dramas for big churches, acting in them, directing some, and designing kitchens and baths or drawing portraits on commission, sometimes hiring my kids to help draw during the Christmas rush. I was learning the craft of screenwriting with an eye to producing my own films. I had enrolled in film school and moved to Hollywood, just prior to learning I had cancer.

TamperedWith,https://www.inspire.com/m/TamperedWith/,"There could be already a discussion on here about this but there are so many discussions to scroll through so I am just going to start my own in hopes to get answers.

I received my positive HSV II test results yesterday and I want to know what this entails sexually. Specifically, if myself and my committed partner both have HSV II, could this cause more frequent outbreaks? Or does this mean we could pass it back and forth? And, could this put us at greater risk of spreading it to other areas of our bodies? For example, Oral Sex, could this spread it to our mouths? I know it says to abstain from sex when having an outbreak but it also says that you could have very little symptoms and not know you are having an outbreak at times. I am asking all of these questions because I am allergic to latex. Therefore I cannot use latex condoms. I am told non-latex condoms do not protect you from STD's. I am a very sexual person and it has always been a healthy part of my life. Honestly, I will go insane if this means I must live with out it. Help! I need answers please....","February 7, 2014 at 11:23 am",15 Replies,"About TamperedWith

bblue51,https://www.inspire.com/m/bblue51/,"I'm having a difficult time. I have been with the same BF for 10 years. I was just diagnosed with HSV1 in the genital area. I have had cold sores for years but have always been careful not to do anything oral if having and outbreak or if I even suspected I was about to. He is aware of the diagnosis and now he doesn't want sex ( oral or genital) at all. I asked him to get tested to see if he has already been exposed or if he hasn't been, we can take appropriate precautions. I'm thinking he's embarrassed to go to his Dr to get checked??? I really need to know so we can get on with things. I am devastated and embarrassed so I understand where he may be coming from but it seems selfish to just ignore the issue. We had sex the day before the outbreak that sent me to the Dr. It would seem to me that he has already been exposed at some point in the past 10 years and he would want to know if he now carries the virus. I know that he won't show positive for 16 weeks if I exposed him from the last encounter but if he has already been exposed, we would know.... ugh...what can I say to get him in to be tested????","June 15, 2014 at 10:11 pm",2 Replies,"About bblue51

mark141,https://www.inspire.com/m/mark141/,"I was diagnosed with HSV 2 about 3 years ago. I was in a long distance relationship with a female for a year already but had never met her. She has a huge problem with germs and ofcourse people getting tested for std’s. She was stern about this. I had led a very unhealthy sexual lifestyle as a young man. I was now 30 but I was afraid of my past, especially my teenage years. Still, I was sure I didn't have anything because I never had any symptoms. Anyways, I got tested for all STD’s right before I went to visit her but didn't get the results until I was already at her place and we had already done multiple sexual acts including intercourse.


They called me and told me that I had HSV 2 on my genitals. I was floored. I was sure that someone in my recent past had knowingly given it to me. I was on suicide watch in my own mind. I was so depressed and I knew that it wasn't HIV but I also felt that it wasn't far behind. Infact, I was scared to death when I got the call and heard the doctor say the H and the V. All I thought about was them calling me to tell me that I had HIV but luckily it was only HSV but it didn't matter to me. I felt basically the same way as if they told me it was the other. I felt alone with no one to talk to. I tried to talk to the doctors & nurses on the phone at the health department but didn't feel a lot of sympathy. It was the same when I went to the pharmacy to pickup the meds. I just felt like no one cared and I was a scar on the world.


Again, I was so angry at the recent partners I had before my current gf. However, after doing some research and looking at pics, I realized that I had HSV 2 for over a decade, dating back to when I was a teen that had unprotected sex with just about any female I met. It never crossed my mind that they bumps I would get once or twice a year on my penis was herpes or any std. I just always felt that my penis was rubbing against my boxers wrong or the zipper on my pants that caused a rash and it would go away in less than a week. It never dawned on me that It may have been something else but sure enough it was the virus. That gave me mixed feelings. One is that I wondered about all the people I may have infected in the past and 2 is that I felt some relief in knowing that this isn't new, that Ive had it for over a decade, but it never really affected my life in any way. I knew then that I could atleast live a normal life with it.


I went on my meds. Acyclovier 2 capsules, 2 times per day. I told the Health department about all my past partners although I was scared. I knew I would want someone to do that for me. However, the problem was my current gf. She’s pretty 50/50 in that on one hand she’s the sweetest person you would ever meet. She has helped me so much and saved my life in so many ways. On the other hand she had a hard upbringing which makes her pretty cold & judgmental at times. I feared telling her for multiple reasons and couldn't bring myself to do it. I kept a close eye on her since she’s been open with me and would tell me if she ever had any kind of discomfort. She never seemed to get any symptoms. Meanwhile, Im taking my meds every single day faithfully. Combine that with already having it for 10 years, I was told that my disease was probably pretty dormant and chances of my effecting someone from now on were very low even with unprotected sex.


Sure enough 3 more years have gone by. She’s had no symptoms, we see eachother a lot now and she became pregnant after being told she probably would never be able to have kids. I thought I couldn't either because of all the things I did when I was younger. I had so much unprotected sex and never pulled out and I never got anyone pregnant but somehow we found out and it seemed like a blessing. However, one huge problem came up. The doctor who put me on my meds told me I wold have to be on them for life but every January 1st, my prescription is stopped and I have to go see the doctor. I never wanted to do this and she had already said it was a life long thing anyways so she would always just give me a new prescription for the year without even seeing me. Again, its been 3 years since my diagnosis and I literally hadn't had one outbreak. Not even anything close. Then this past new year came and again my meds are stopped. I call to get them refilled but this time they tell me that the doctor is no longer with them and they have a new guy now who I must see before he refills them.


I give in and go to see him. He says him and the previous doctor use to argue about the meds a lot because he feels that research has shown that you don't need to take meds every day the rest of your life. That just wait until you feel an outbreak coming on and then take some for a week. I told him that Im truly not comfortable with that. That Ive heard others that do it but it doesn't seem safe to me and I am use to taking this every day. He said I don't need it and I may never have one again after having HSV 2 for almost 15 years and being on meds nonstop for 3 years. He gives me some pills from the office if I ever need for an emergency and he writes me a new prescription just incase of the future but tells me to not take meds everyday. I give in. I was so scared and felt so weird but he was right as nothing happened. I went to see my girl again for the 1st time since I found out she was pregnant. She was now going on 6 months. It is June and I also have been off my meds for 6 months. Everything is lovely until one day I feel a tingle on my penis and here it comes. Everything happened so quick. I was out of state and forgot the meds at home. I was only suppose to be there 10 days and then go back home for a summer semester of school until I come back down in her 8th month where I will live with her permanently.


The meds are home and its the weekend. Im not even sure if this is an outbreak since I hadn't had one in so long but I think it could be. It was usually a big area of sores but this time it was just like one or 2 sores. My girl wanted to have sex. I panicked so much. Even though we were always unprotected, I kept condoms on me just incase. Everything was happening so quick and I was scared to say NO and have her ask why. Then what would I say? I told her I wasn't feeling good but she wouldn't stop. I was so scared. I put a condom in my pocket with her not knowing but she grabbed me, pulled me close to her, and started performing oral sex on me. I didn't think she would do that. It threw me completely off. Everything was a mess. 1st off it hurt because of my sore, 2nd all I could do was think about me having an outbreak, 3rd I knew that I had read that chances are very very very very low of giving her HSV 2 from her performing oral sex on me. Normally I wouldn't ejaculate but this time I forced myself to just so we didn't have to have sex. Still, later she wanted some and I put a condom on without her knowing and had sex with her.


Literally, the very next day she showed my a rash on the back of her hand that was itching and it looked exactly like the herpes blisters that I get on my penis except smaller. I was so confused but at the same time knew where it came from. We also had sex the previous 2 days unprotected but I didn't have open sores. It made me wonder a lot of things. I was always told that Herpes took atleast 2 days to show up so how can she get the signs just 12 hours later. Then I read that in some rare cases they do showup the next day. Then I wondered did I maybe give it to her the other previous 2 days? Was I shedding before I had sores and didn't know it? I was wondering how did she get it when I had a condom on? Is it because she grabbed my penis and went down on me? Everything I read said it was very low risk for that. Then I thought maybe I had rubbed my penis on her vagina or close enough to it. Maybe I touched my infection and put my hand between her legs but I couldn't remember. I thought maybe after intercourse, I took the condom off too soon to hide it from her and maybe some fluids got crossed over. I just didn't know.


I was so upset. I hated my doctor for telling me to go off my meds. Even moreso I hated myself for not being man enough to tell her that I was having an outbreak. Why let her go down or me or have sex? I should've thought of something quick? Im a lowlife piece of crap. That's how I felt. It just all happened so fast that I froze. What about her? What about my baby? How could I let this happen? Why did I stop taking my meds? Why didn't I leave on time? Oh yes, I got off track earlier in my story but I meant to say that I was only suppose to be there 10 days but I changed my flight and had it pushed back another week. Literally the very next day after I was suppose to go back is when I had an outbreak. I only stayed for her and it backfired because I gave her herpes but maybe I gave it to her a couple of days before that anyways? All of this was running through my head. I still didn't have the guts to tell her. I went and got more meds the next day. I was still having sex with her. Each time with a condom that she didnt know about. I pushed my flight back 2 more times and have been here for another 3 weeks.


I was kinda happy for a sec because her hand bumps went away pretty quick but then it came right back again. At the same time she said she feels like she’s about to get a pimple on her lip. She said she can feel it coming. She told me to look and you can see it getting red. Sure enough it was but it never came. It went right away like her hand and never returned. Her hand came back though then it went away pretty quick again. Now it came back a 3rd time and this time she now also has it on her opposite wrist. I started to freakout. l I think my girl has a weak immune system and she’s not a fighter when it comes to things that itch. She cant help but to scratch it so I knew it would be hard to heal. I did a ton of research and had all these questions. I read that I cant give her hsv 1 if I only have hsv 2 so Im positive that's what she has. However, I wondered was it only on her hand & wrist but not her vagina since she had no symptoms there and I wore a condom? Everything I read said different things. I wondered could it be Herpetic Whitlow but those things seem like on the finger tips while her’s is on the back of her hand and on the wrist. I read about zolster but she’s already had chicken pox. I read that if its above the waist then its oral HSV 2. Then I read that its the genital one but it has spread. I was going crazy.


I was hoping that maybe she got it somehow only on her hand/wrist and nowhere else. That its not on her genitals. I was trying to tell her that she needs to stop scratching and it seems contagious. I told her that its spreading but she kept scratching and had no relief. We were going to have sex again, she put her hand between her legs and I got upset at her and told her not do to that right now. I wasn't mean at all but more concerned and she said that she’s fine, its just a lil rash but it got worse. I read that you cant spread herpes to other parts after the initial infection but this is her 1st one so I was trying to get her to stop before she does it more & more. Yesterday she told me she has some bumps on the bottom of her belly and it looked a little like it but wasn't sure. Im just so scared. I hinted to her a few days ago that it maybe herpes but you can tell she didn't buy that. We tried Benadryl spray, alcohol, and others to stop the itching but nothing worked. She’s been showing her family the rash which was driving me crazy. I even got crazy enough to where the last couple of nights I put some of my acyclovir on ice cream or a donut and gave it to her without her knowing.


After she started scratching so bad last night I finally confessed everything to her and she’s been an emotional wreck. We use to not get along a lot anyways because she has a bad attitude at times while Im a pretty laid back dude. Her mother is very all knowing and overprotective so we don't get along all the time either. I just knew everything was going to come to a head. My girl has gone back & forth from crying uncontrollably to then being violent and attacking me. She said I ruined her life. She said she would've never been with me if she had known. She never talks about what happened a couple of weeks ago with the sores and me letting her go down on me. Instead she focuses about me knowing for 3 years and never telling her. She said she would've never done that to me. She said no one is going to want her and she doesn't want to be with me again. She then breaks down thinking about our baby. She said that the baby is probably going to have it and even if she doesn't at birth, that she wont be able to touch her because she will be so scared of infecting her with her hand & wrist like that. She is so distraught. One time she says she doesn't even want the baby anymore but then she changes.


She also got mad at me for giving her the meds since she might cant even take them when pregnant. Then she read about the 1st outbreak stuff late in pregnancy and she is going crazy. I told her that everything she is saying is right. I feel like Im the worst person on earth. I take full blame. I do at times get so upset at that doctor for taking me off the meds but I say that if I didn't let her go down on me that night or would've just not had sex when I saw the sore then the doctor still may have been right and I wouldn't have passed it on so its all my fault but maybe I was shedding before then and gave it to her anyways. She still brings up the 3 years thing but I told her that I didn't find out until after we had already had intercourse and by that time I felt like you either already would have it or Im on the meds now so she wouldn't get it. She had test she thinks for herpes when she got pregnant and came back negative. I was so happy at that time and thanked god because it had bothered me for years but now I went and screwed it up right after that anyways at the worst possible time. Right when she’s pregnant.


I feel so bad. I wish I could have it all back. The 3 years. The 3 weeks. People are so scared to say anything but then they end up having to say something anyways when its 10x worse because you have now infected them which is the one thing you wanted to avoid and could've avoided if you would've told them sooner. If she had known then it would've been her decision. That's what she keeps telling me. I decided her life for her and its not fair. She is so right and everything she feels now is how I felt when I got diagnosed. I told her I already went through that but its not a death sentence and it really doesn't change anything in your life but you can tell that she doesn't want to hear that from me of all people. Im the one guy she doesn't want to hear it from. I don't think we will get through this. I will never forgive myself. Im a great person and Im of age now at 34 yet I managed to do something so selfish, so immature, and so repugnant to someone who loves me so much. Can someone please help me atleast by answering some of the following questions:


1-Did I definitely give her hsv 2 and nothing else?

2-Is it possible that she only has it on her hand/wrist and not her genitals or does it still mean that it definitely started In the genitals?

3-is it possible that its oral hsv2 and not genital?

4-if its went away and came back multiple times in a short span, does that mean its still the 1st outbreak or are these already reoccurring? I just want to make sure that its done spreading so her antibodies can build up and she has no risk of getting it anywhere else, especially the genitals

5-Is all herpes dangerous for your baby during pregnancy or is it strictly if you are having a vaginal outbreak at the time of birth? I keep hearing mixed things on this? Like is my baby still at risk if its only on her hands/wrist and or oral?

6-if it doesn't spread anymore during this outbreak and its not on her vagina, does that mean it will be impossible for her to get it on her vagina in the future since she will have built up the antibodies?

7-Ive heard some say that when you have hsv2 in areas like your hand that its less likely to reoccur or atleast reoccur often while others have said that it will happen more often than the normal kind. Do you know?

8-I use to hear that if you take the meds every day like you are suppose to then chances of you infecting someone even with unprotected sex is very low but it seems like on here that you guys still sound like its 50/50 if you are taking meds every day.

9-It seems like her blisters maybe really contagious and even I feel like Im about to get rashes in some areas but then they never come. Is it possible that she has some kind of herpes that I still can get in other spots or is it just trying to maybe do stuff to me but my antibodies wont let it?

10-will a vaginal hsv2 outbreak always hurt and if she does have it on her hands/wrist with painful itching and scratching, would she also get that same itch on her vagina if she had it down there? Again, she hasn't had any symptoms down there and Im hoping she doesn't.

11- Can she transfer it to her eyes? She's been messing with her eyes alot. Some of it maybe allergies but Im still scared that she is spreading it to them.




All of this was very long and Im sure there will be some things later that I wish I would've added but atleast I hope I get some answers. She will be going to the doctor soon to get all the answers even though she wants me out of her life now. Her mother will know soon which will be hell to deal with but I deserve it all. Thanks for the help either way

Haolegirl13,https://www.inspire.com/m/Haolegirl13/,"I'm 25 and the only two men I've slept with, without a condom, I contracted an STD. I contracted HPV from my ex-husband and was informed last November that my then fiancé cheated and contracted herpes. I was tested and popped positive for HSV-2.

I stupidly let my hormones take over and had vaginal sex with a guy (yes we used condoms) without disclosing my STDs. To be honest, I'm so ashamed of it. I can tell this guy is really starting to like me more than we imagined. I NEED to tell him. I know he doesn't have anything because he was married for 12 years (recently divorced). Haha he hasn't bought condoms in forever--didn't know they now make latex-free condoms! So needless to say, the HPV and HSV2 issues are a big deal. Does anyone have any suggestions for bringing it up? How to word it?? I feel like saying ""I'm a complete a-hole for not telling you, but I have HPV and HSV and I understand if you don't care to talk to me or if you decide to immediately walk out.."" Or randomly saying ""hey, so I need to tell you that I have herpes and HPV."" I feel like I should tell him when he's at my place so that he feels that it's ok to leave if he gets upset...

jflanagan61789,https://www.inspire.com/m/jflanagan61789/,"So, since joining Inspire, I've been getting a lot of amazing feedback and I'm very grateful for all of it. BUT now, I'm worrying, because I have yet to tell anyone in my family that I have these bumps on my cervix. My fiance knows. I told him immediately. He tries to say that I'll be fine, but I think he's afraid, too. And I spent the whole weekend with his family and I wanted to tell his Mom, because she's always been very supportive and there for me when I need her. She's an amazing person to just talk things through to. But for some reason, I just couldn't get the words out. Every time I would think ""okay, tell her"" it just wouldn't come out. I felt like, because it was her Mom's birthday and we were focusing on that, if I mentioned it I'd be sounding like an attention whore. Now the same thing is happening with my Mom and sister, because they're both literally right this minute in the hospital, because my sister just had her first baby. I'm really happy for her, but at the same time I want to talk about me and my problems. I don't want to take attention away from anyone else, but I want people to know that I'm having a potentially serious problem. Is that wrong? Should I just wait until I come back from the doctor and get my results back to say anything? I don't want people to worry if it turns out to be nothing, but I feel like I should give them a heads up. Any advice? I'm so out of my element and I have no idea what to do!","April 8, 2014 at 11:45 am",10 Replies,"About jflanagan61789

Hi! My name is Jennifer. I'm 24, almost 25. I'm engaged and have 2 beautiful children. My son, Evan, is 3 and turns 4 in June. And my daughter, Genevieve, just turned 1 in January. I was diagnosed with HPV back in 2008 after having a routine pap smear and my test coming back abnormal. Naturally, I freaked, because I didn't know what that meant for me as a woman. Then I learned that it can lead to cervical cancer. I'm especially concerned, because my Aunt was diagnosed with cervical cancer a few years back and it's apparently hereditary on my father's side. I'm not close with that side of my family, so I don't really have anyone to talk to about these things. Of course, I have at least one amazing friend that's been trying to be there when I worry too much and she always calms me down, but I guess I'm just interested in knowing how other people deal with similar situations."
gerrismith,https://www.inspire.com/m/gerrismith/,"Good afternoon, I recently rekindled a relationship with my high school sweetheart after 30 years and we are madly in love with each other. I have not yet disclosed to him that I have HSV2, as we have not been intimate since we live on separate coasts. My preference would be to tell him in person because I really want to see his reaction which will help me find the right words. Is it wrong to have him fly out here without disclosing first? If so, is there any recommendations on how to successfully disclose over the phone? I just really think it would be a more positive outcome is we could see each other vs. phone. Please let me know your thoughts, share stories and/or provide recommendations. I am desperate and do not want to lose him.

Sincerely, lost and confused.

jflanagan61789,https://www.inspire.com/m/jflanagan61789/,"Tonight, I had the first major scare since being diagnosed with HPV. I guess I always knew that it could lead to cervical cancer, but tonight it really hit me how possible it is for me. I guess I didn't worry so much when my periods became so irregular, because that's pretty much always been normal for me. I didn't worry at all when I had random brown-ish, bloody mucous come out in between. I thought it was just spotting. But tonight I was the most scared I've ever been in my life. I was using the restroom and about to shower. I peed. Wiped. Slightly bloody. I thought to myself ""hmm..this is weird. I just had my period last week. More spotting?"". So I did an examination, which I sometimes do to reassure myself that I'm just being paranoid and everything is fine, and I felt a bump. Naturally, I flipped and did a Google search. Of course, MY life has to become more complicated! Having 2 children, trying to buy a house,planning my dream wedding on an extremely tight budget and fighting an eviction with landlords that won't fix my furnace clearly aren't enough! Right? So, my Google search comes up with 3 possibilities: 1. Nabothian cysts 2. Cervical cancer and 3. Genital warts. I clicked on cervical cancer first, hoping to eliminate it. WRONG! I have every single symptom. Not most or some or 1 or 2. Straight up ALL of them. The irregular bleeding, obviously. All of the ""bad"" discharges: pale, watery, brown, foul-smelling and tinged with blood. Of course, I don't get all of them at the exact same time, but I constantly have at least one of them. I have almost constant back pain, which I chocked up to a family of bad backs. Difficulty urinating? Yep, I've got that! Thought that was just nerve damage I gained from the birth of my daughter, since that's when it all started. Trouble...how do I say this politely? I know! I'll use the medical term..defecating. I thought that was just poor diet, since I'm a stay-at-home Mom that seems to never have time to shower, let alone eat properly. Hmm..I guess I lucked out on not getting the swelling of the legs. GO ME! ONE WHOLE SYMPTOM(SO FAR) THAT I DON'T HAVE!! Fatigue..again, I thought it was just pure exhaustion. From what? I'm not sure. My kids sleep all night, every night and ALWAYS have since day 1. Lucky me, right?! But, honestly, I normally go to bed by 10p.m. and sleep until 9-10a.m. That's probably not normal. Well, at least not when I do it every day. Ugh. I unfortunately didn't get lucky enough to be blessed with the weight loss symptom. And lastly, and definitely the most annoying symptom I have, other than the bumps(which is kind of a given..) is all the discomfort I experience during sex. I mean, I'm not trying to brag or anything, but I thought it was just because my fiance has some pretty big man business. I'm not kidding. His junk's bigger than my face! I know that a bump doesn't always mean cancer. I'm not naive. I did look at what nabothian cysts are, but I'm not convinced that that's what mine are. Everyone that seemed to have them said that there's don't hurt. Mine are painful to touch. Then I have all of these other symptoms that no one else seems to have. I feel like I'm going crazy and like I'm the only person in the world to be going through this, but that can't be true. Somewhere, someone has to be experiencing this, too. All in all, I'm glad I found this site and hopefully someone out there can give me advice or at least share with me their symptoms and how they deal with all of this, too. And FYI, I'm making it a point to call my Gyno ASAP!!

baddream,https://www.inspire.com/m/baddream/,"What a nightmare.
Started with a tiny weird dot close to the back opening of my vagina - went to my DR. ""Oh"" she says, ""it's no big deal"" she says. ""Warts are common a lot of people have them."" Come here doc while I slap you in the face... With a chair. I tell her she must be wrong & to check again - next time come back to me with a better verdict Instead she grabs the aerosol can filled with Antarctica and tells me it will ""pinch"" a little. She tells me to keep an eye on it. One moment please - I seem to have forgotten how to breathe. My look of disgust and panic finally registers with her. She asks if I have any questions. I have 100 but all I can manage to say is uhhh. So she does what any good DR would do, sits beside me, compassionately rubs my back and says ""really, this is quite common and treatable, you are in a strong relationship, you're healthy, and you and Ben will deal with this"". FUCK - BEN. I have to tell him. Wait - did he give this to me? That means he cheated? At that point I reached for the trash and heaved my tuna sandwich lunch up. DR Badnews goes on to tell me either of us could have had it, it is something that can prowl dormant for months and don't play the he gave she gave game. You both have the virus now be proactive. Right. Fuck you.
I drive home... Is this a before bed kind of convo? Do I toss it In over supper as we discuss our day? Pass the salt oh I have HPV. What's HPV? Warts on my vagina... There goes our nice supper. I decide there is no good time to tell him and I will just grieve in silence and avoid sex until this thing goes away. No such luck. Apparently when you are in love your partner immediately suspects when something's wrong. So I tell him. Before bed - great pillow talk. He says he's never cheated and had no clue and he loves me it's not horrible blah blah blah. Is it wrong that I wished for him to have a wart or two at that moment?! We checked him out he was good - Although we were both relieved I felt like I was in this alone. Everything continued as normal still just the one little bastard wart. Fast forward 2 months I literally woke up with two major clusters. Devastation is an understatement.","January 22, 2014 at 6:06 pm",10 Replies,"About baddream

This is me on the right. I did weight loss surgery in February 2013 and have lost 120 pounds this year. I was really excited and met someone new in December. I had been sick quite a bit this fall because I was renting a room in a basement and the lady could not afford to heat it. Then I met someone new at a church and after being with him twice, I started to have symptoms and was told I have Herpes I.

I am really scared and not sure how to process this. I have left the church because the pastor's wife was very judgmental and hurtful. The guys test came up negative so I guess I am the one who got the scarlet letter.

I met someone new and was up front about things and he is being nice but he is afraid to even kiss me. I am trying to learn about this but there are no support groups in this area that I know of. I am really from the
Richmond Virginia area and don't know this area well. I am near Charlottesville or Fredericksburg, Culpeper.

Any suggestions? Blessings. PDSM."
JohnNovack,https://www.inspire.com/m/JohnNovack/,"The Inspire Q&A: Inspire talks with Don Dizon, MD

Dear members,

We at Inspire are pleased to bring you the latest in a series of Q&A interviews with people who are making contributions to helping patients and caregivers worldwide. We post these interviews in a question-and-answer format in my Inspire Journal here as a news feature for Inspire group members across our many support communities.

Don S. Dizon is a medical oncologist, specializing in women’s cancers and sexual health. He sees patients in the Gillette Center for Gynecologic Cancers at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and is the founder and director of the Oncology Sexual Health Clinic. He is a Deputy Editor in Oncology and Palliative Care at UpToDate and a member of the Cancer Communications Committee for the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). He is actively engaged in social media, and is a regular columnist at ASCO Connection. In 2013, his column received a Grand Apex Award for best blog series. He’s on Twitter at @drdonsdizon.

I talked to Dr. Dizon about how patients can more efficiently advocate for themselves, and how social media is changing the patient/physician relationship. Here is a transcript of our conversation, which is edited for space and grammar:

Inspire: How can patients more effectively get involved into their care plan?
Dizon: Personally, I think we need to rethink how care plans are being utilized in oncology using a chronic disease model--sort of like how it is with patients with diabetes or heart failure, where treatments are ongoing. Patients are undergoing care from the beginning--so talking about a care plan only at the end of treatment assumes that only patients treated with curative intent need one, and that the only time patient input is needed is at the end of the initial therapy. In my opinion, a care plan is dynamic and constantly changing.

When it comes to care, then, I think the most important thing patients can do is to get involved in their care early on and express a desire in engagement. I believe there is still an assumption that patients want their physicians to direct care, that is, “These are the things you should be thinking about and of those, this is the one I’d do.” That’s a fairly one-sided, “I’m the driver, you’re the passenger” model of care that I think probably in the next five years, hopefully sooner, will shift.

Inspire: What kind of shift?
Dizon: It’s going to be more participatory because information is more freely available and less under control of clinicians. Through online resources, patients have easier access to patient communities, where advice and knowledge are shared, far from the doctor’s office. As a result, more patients are going to be educated, will want to discuss what they’ve learned, and will want to have a say in their management. This participatory movement in medicine will be challenging for us as clinicians, but I think and hope it will be met with enthusiasm.

Inspire: That sounds like a big change.
Dizon: Yes and no, because it is already happening. However, it may be too stark of a contrast, and too much of an evolution to expect your physicians to do, especially where a doctor has been used to fairly passive patients who greet their recommendations with, “Yes, doctor, this is what I’m going to do, doctor, I’m going to listen to your advice, doctor.” To suddenly switch from that to more active engagement--something like, “Well, my online community said this is what I should be doing, so let’s talk about it,” that might be too much.

Inspire: So, what’s a good starting strategy?
Dizon: Do your homework about your particular disease, learn the terminology, seek to understand what the current options are. If a patient coming to see me is medically oriented, or one of their loved ones accompanying them is, the conversation may be much more technical and if I am getting feedback that I’m being understood, then I will engage with them on a different level than one I might use on a patient without that medical background. It’s about being informed.

Inspire: In your own experience as a physician, what is going on when you are having discussions with that kind of patient?
Dizon: I talk with engaged patients almost like I would a peer. It’s an exchange of ideas, thoughts, and a more thoughtful discussion. I can engage informed patients on a much higher level. These conversations can be more demanding on me--not disrespectfully. It’s just that superficial platitudes are insufficient. They want to understand the evidence, learn more about benefits and risks.

Inspire: You wrote a column last fall about patients enrolling in clinical trials, and you referenced trial participants as “trailblazers.” What stumbling blocks do you see in increased participation in trials?
Dizon: Overall, there are certain barriers that are inherent to the process of clinical trials. For patients, managing expectations is probably the key to feeling like you were not a research subject and that we treated you as a patient.

There are several specific challenges. First is understanding the clinical trial structures, and understanding what is being requested of you. I think when many people hear “clinical trials” they hope that it offers better than the standard of care. That’s a very broad generalization about trials, because they are not all the same. In Phase one, we want to define safety and what doses are best to use on humans; it’s not even about outcomes important to any one patient--survival, response, for example. In Phase two, we want to know how well it can work, while in Phase three we want to know if a treatment is better than the currently available treatment.

The second barrier is expectations--most people will come into a study thinking that if it’s a trial it has to be promising. Again, it will depend on the trial, and more and more, will depend on matching the right patient to the right trial. Hopefully, better understanding the cancer on an individual level will help us do that.

A third barrier is infrastructure. For example, the entire process of looking an informed consent is fairly arduous. The presentation of risk can seem incredibly scary on paper, and it can be the first time people have really thought about the release of private health information. The whole notion of privacy comes into question. Also, as someone who sees a lot of referrals from neighboring states, oftentimes a barrier can be as simple yet complicated as, “How am I supposed to come up here to Boston every week? That’s not practical.”

Everything is swollen, I can't even count how many sores I have. Also, there seems to be A LOT of blood. Like I am concerned I may have gotten my period 2 weeks early due to stress, there's that much blood. However, I really can't tell if it could be due to the herpes, like if I have sores inside of my vagina or something. It has been bleeding for about 2 days now. I just don't know what to do! I've been showering twice a day, keeping the area as dry as possible (which isn't really happening thanks to all the blood) and I've been using tea tree oil, taking pain meds and moving as little as possible. I just need to know how long until I start to notice at least some improvement?

By John Novack, Communications Director, Inspire

Dear members,

We at Inspire are pleased to bring you the latest in a series of interviews with people who are making contributions to helping patients and caregivers worldwide. The people in this Q&A series may not have the same background as you, or be affected by the same type of disease or condition as you, but we hope you find their comments interesting and insightful. We post these interviews in a question-and-answer format in my Inspire Journal here as a news feature for all Inspire community members.

We spoke recently with Kathy Nieder, MD, a staff physician at Baptist Medical Associates in Louisville, KY She is board certified in family practice. In addition to patient care she is a physician champion for the ambulatory electronic health records (EHR) at Baptist. Her involvement in healthcare technology stems from what she calls her “long-time geekiness.”

Nieder blogs at kathyniedermd.com. You can connect with her on Twitter at @docnieder, and on Google+ as well.

Inspire: You blogged about using a whiteboard to help you communicate with your patients. Why do you think using a whiteboard has made for more effective interactions? Is it the way that the information is displayed, or the act of you using that tool, that you think makes it effective?
Nieder: Not being an artist, I think the act of writing on the board helps me to be more engaged. I’m up out of my seat, away from the computer; I’m moving and able to be much animated. Plus, when I post information that the patient finds useful, they enjoy taking a picture of it, to look up further information later.

Inspire: How would you define the term “empowered patient?”
Nieder: Empowered patients are individuals who are deeply interested in their health and taking steps to find providers and institutions that will allow them to partner in their care. They are actively looking for health information on the web. They are much more interesting to take care of because they ask questions that challenge me to be better informed.

Inspire: When you feel that you have a great interaction with a patient, what do you think are the key common components?
Nieder: Understanding on two levels—intellectual & emotional. I often come away feeling energized because of a common connection.

Inspire: I asked this question in an earlier interview here with Dr. Howard Luks, who, like you, is active in healthcare social media. How do you think patients can best communicate to their clinicians what they’ve learned from online research?
Nieder: Having the source, or sources, of their research is most important. This gives me an idea of how trustworthy the information is. Beyond that the communication will depend on the clinician. Choosing physicians who want to partner with their patients is key. A patient won’t know until they ask.

Inspire: You are active in healthcare social networks. I’m sure you’re busy, and your social media activity comes at a cost of time. How would you justify that investment to physicians who are skeptical of “digital doctors?”
Nieder: I wrote a blog about this also. The most impressive thing about my social media activity to other physicians is how I use it as a means to keep up on the latest healthcare news. For instance, I’ve been using the ABIM (American Board of Internal Medicine) Foundation’s ""Choosing Wisely"" recommendations since they came out in April 2012. I didn’t realize that some of my associates had only vaguely heard of them. They were impressed that I knew so much and I was shocked that they didn’t. But they “got” the fact that I knew about it through social media.

Add to that the healthcare thought leaders I’ve met in real life thru social media and the improvements in my care of patients thanks to those thought leaders and one has a compelling reason for getting involved. In the long run the time investment has been well worth it.","December 6, 2013 at 11:48 am",35 Replies,"About JohnNovack

Walter,https://www.inspire.com/m/Walter/,"Hello everyone,

Today at Inspire we’re excited to announce the launch of a new feature, and it’s one that many of you have requested -- the ability to upload photos to Inspire.

You can now add photos to any post you make in Inspire. It works quite simply, and I’ve included a few “photos” with this post that show how to use the feature.
Whenever you write a post -- whether it’s a discussion or a journal entry, or a reply to either -- you’ll see an icon of a flower with the words “Add photos.” Simply click that icon to add photos to your post.
You’ll be asked where you want to get the photos from. You can upload photos from your computer, phone or other device, or re-use photos that you previously uploaded to Inspire. You don’t have to upload photos a second time, in order to include them in a new post.
Any photos you upload will become part of a “gallery” in your profile. You can see (and manage) all of your photos in your gallery, and can browse the galleries of other Inspire members.
Photos that you upload will be visible to all logged-in Inspire members. Someone must be an Inspire member, and log in, in order to see your photos.
You can add captions to your photos to describe what they’re about. We hope you’ll do this, so that when others view your photo gallery, they can understand what your photos are of and about.
When you add a photo, you have the option to mark the photo as “sensitive.” Marking a photo as sensitive means other members will need to click on a placeholder image before they can see it. We included this feature because as a site dealing with health issues, we know that some photos that we may legitimately wish to share with each other may nevertheless be upsetting or otherwise difficult to look at. The “sensitive photo” feature exists for this reason. Please use it if you think a photo you are uploading could be upsetting or triggering to other members, or maybe just not appropriate for where someone might be using Inspire (e.g. the public library, public transportation).
We hope you all enjoy this feature and that it helps make Inspire even more helpful for you. If you have any questions about how it works, or find any problems with it, please don’t hesitate to submit a help request or write us at team@inspire.com.

And please feel free to share some photos in replies to this post, to give the feature a try.

Thank you!

Walter

This is me on the right. I did weight loss surgery in February 2013 and have lost 120 pounds this year. I was really excited and met someone new in December. I had been sick quite a bit this fall because I was renting a room in a basement and the lady could not afford to heat it. Then I met someone new at a church and after being with him twice, I started to have symptoms and was told I have Herpes I.

I am really scared and not sure how to process this. I have left the church because the pastor's wife was very judgmental and hurtful. The guys test came up negative so I guess I am the one who got the scarlet letter.

I met someone new and was up front about things and he is being nice but he is afraid to even kiss me. I am trying to learn about this but there are no support groups in this area that I know of. I am really from the
Richmond Virginia area and don't know this area well. I am near Charlottesville or Fredericksburg, Culpeper.

Any suggestions? Blessings. PDSM."

We are the team behind this site. We feel very fortunate to be able to work on a project that can make a real difference in helping people to live their lives happily.

Inspire was created in 2005 by a group of friends. We were each dealing with important medical issues in our families, and we found that while the Internet was a useful source for authoritative medical information, it was not a safe, welcoming place for us to find support.

We created Inspire to change all that. We envisioned a place where we as patients, caregivers, family and friends could support one another, and where we could do so in a safe, secure, privacy-protected environment.

We are dedicated to building the best online health communities possible. Like our community members, all of us have faced health challenges of our own - and we know from personal experience how valuable the support and encouragement of others can be.

Our tagline, 'Together We're Better', is at the heart of what we do."
livlovlrn,https://www.inspire.com/m/livlovlrn/,"So, had some interaction with ""Team Inspire"" and realize this is just a chat room. This has very little - if any- resemblance to the original board. There are no medical professionals here (unlike the previous board), in case you were not aware. The only purpose of this board is for people to support each other. This has value but is not what I am looking for. I appreciated the open, honest responses to somewhat strange or very personal questions that came up on the old board. Things many of us thought about but had no one to ask. I hate to inform Team Inspire who recommends that we ask our health care providers our questions, many of the doctors out there are CLUELESS!!! about herpes. I experienced that and the old board confirmed this again and again. WE NEED SOME EXPERTS ON H to provide support and answer questions. Team Inspire If you are worried about law suits if you provide medical experts then put a disclaimer in your subscriber form - it seems to work for everyone else. I will be unsubscribing - this site is disappointing to me and does not meet my needs. Good luck to all.","January 9, 2014 at 10:16 pm",4 Replies,"About livlovlrn

cancancer,https://www.inspire.com/m/cancancer/,"I had a PAP smear finally, after years of omitting to have one. Now they test for HPV. I should not have been surprised to find that I have HPV... I had it in college, after a rape... but it confirmed my fears about the possible origin of my anal cancer. My PAP had abnormal cells, too, so a biopsy was scheduled.

I read up on cervical cancer. when it spreads, it can block ureters, causing hydronephrosis and eventually destroying the kidneys, which cannot drain. I had had a blocked ureter, several stents, many UTIs, the last of which led to sepsis... and I have had my dead kidney removed. The doctors said radiation had probably damaged the ureter. But now I was worried.

The next place cervical cancer spreads is to the rectum. My giant tumor had been in my rectum as well as my anal canal, and in nearby lymph nodes. I worried that HPV had started the whole cancer thing in my cervix, and that everything was a direct result of the HPV... and I so wanted to blame the rapist who had gotten to me in college...

I was terrified of learning I had advanced cervical cancer and worried I'd have little resistance to the cut/poison/burn system of cancer abatement. I really would prefer to stop harming my body in an effort to kill cancer..

But the biopsy results showed only mild dysplasia. If the cancer did begin in the cervix, it is now dead and gone, and I am not.

Happy New Year, everybody. I wish you joy and peace and health and long life.

Okay.... years into the cancer ""trip"", I think I need to preface the below remarks with a little about who I ""was"" before cancer. An actress, a writer, an artist, a poet or songwriter on occasion... and the mother of four adult children, all working in the arts. One is a fashion designer, two are actress/singer/dancers/writers, and my only son is a composer, arranger, songwriter, and recording engineer. We all live in L.A. and are in varying stages of achieving our biggest dreams. I am the farthest from a goal, but then, for decades, I'd thought I was doing all right, writing big dramas for big churches, acting in them, directing some, and designing kitchens and baths or drawing portraits on commission, sometimes hiring my kids to help draw during the Christmas rush. I was learning the craft of screenwriting with an eye to producing my own films. I had enrolled in film school and moved to Hollywood, just prior to learning I had cancer.

I was diagnosed with cancer on February 2, 2010. It was a malignant neoplasm of the anal canal. The tumor is an adenocarcinoma. I believe that makes it a colorectal cancer, rather than anal cancer, but that's unclear. I read on the Internet that ""Anal Cancer"" is always squamous cell carcinoma"" and... mine wasn't. I also read that squamous cell carcinoma is related to HPV and... adenocarcinoma isn't. But... I read conflicting reports, so I'm not sure what's accurate.

I had chemo and radiation to shrink and kill the tumor and the cancer in the two nearby lymph nodes. When they removed my anus and lymph nodes, the surgeons said they got ""clean margins."" A permanent colostomy was performed. And my ovaries were removed, as a precaution because cancer could hide there. I wasn't menopausal before the radiation but I have been, since. I had unbearable hot flashes and night sweats for several months, but those seem to have subsided. They were the least of my difficulties, though. I had several complications after the surgery. There probably isn't room to list them here, and I haven't the time or inclination to write about them. But they delayed the start of my chemo, and hand and foot syndrome occasioned a one month break from that treatment. I finished it, finally and got the port removed before I knew the PET-CT results. There was a new tumor in a lymph node. It was impeding my kidney from draining and my intestines from emptying. A surgery removed the tumor and repaired the damage. I have had a couple of stents in the affected ureter, and am undergoing chemotherapy to kill off any lurking cancer cells."

Khatn,https://www.inspire.com/m/Khatn/,"This past week has given me a load of rows to hoe and think about. One week ago, my darling (and she truly is) 2-y-o Maine Coon kitten (don't care if she's 2, she's still my little kitten) came to me in the bathroom and I knelt down to pet her but when I looked at her face, I almost fainted from shock. Her right eye was partially protruding from her eyelids. I'm almost starting to cry now, just thinking about it. I picked her up and did a quick assessment. She wasn't panting or sweating and hadn't batted at the eye with her paws, so I figured she wasn't in serious pain, but I knew that eye had to come out and we had to get to a vet and quickly. Of course, it was Sunday and 9:00 pm (EST), so my vet was closed and the only possibility was the extremely expensive emergency vet, but I made a call to my former (my son's dad) and asked if he would drive us to the vet and cover the cost with his credit card till I got my monthly disability check. Thank God, he agreed. Short story: they got her set with an Elizabethan collar and some pain meds and said we could wait till the morning for the operation and have it done by our own vet, not the emergency folks, so the cost would be less prohibitive. I knew it was still going to be expensive, but I knew we'd figure out something.

On the way home, even with the collar and not having the meds kick in yet, she sat on my lap purring and licking my hand as I pet her ears and rubbed her tum. Even with her eye exposed, she still had the love to give me and seemingly reassure me that it was going to be ok and not to worry.

Today, she's home; looking like my little Franken-kitty with 19 stitches across the right side of her face and no right eye, but she's still my little love and crawls into my lap to give me little kisses and big purrs. Though her world has been totally turned sideways (literally -- she has to learn to navigate all over again just using a left eye that doesn't see very well either), she still is happy and glad to be home and forever cuddly and soft and my little miracle.

So what if I can't sleep because the stoma hurts like hell? I still have a cat that loves me even if I made her have a major operation and two nights away from her snugglies in a vet hospital. So what if my bank account is in uproar for a couple of months. The money spent was well worth it and we got help from a generous donation from an unknown fund for which I'm thanking God. We still have our Kynny and she still has us. That's more than enough for now.","August 25, 2013 at 9:04 pm",61 Replies,"About Khatn

SarahLee428,https://www.inspire.com/m/SarahLee428/,"I am currently struggling with the same concept. I have had HSV-2 for almost 2 years & been in a committed, monogamous relationship for 18 months, with a partner who does not have neither virus (1 or 2) I have had no signs/warnings/out breaks since birth that I have oral herpes.. & have been tested on numerous occasions for it. Yesterday morning, I woke up with what seemed to be a pimple on my left cheek.. only it did not look/feel like a pimple. going throughout my day I came to feel that on-set ""tingle"" that every person who has herpes can identify with. It hit me like a ton of bricks.. After hours of obsessive research I was led to believe that if you have HSV2 it is very ""uncommon/rare"" for the virus to move to other parts of the body. I was seen by an urgent care specialist this afternoon ; He took a quick look at my face with a flashlight & said ""You have herpes"" without even letting me explain that I already have genital herpes & I was looking for treatment, as well as some answers for how to care for it. But he did tell me that he was confused as to why my immune system did not fight off the infection, seeing as how it is already present in my body. I have been without medication for 6 months, due to lack of insurance.. but that still doesn't explain this. Since this incident, my boyfriend & I are going to get him tested again, in order to clear up the possibility that he might share the virus. Although, since we have started dating, I was honest with him about my condition & he has not performed oral sex on me.
Needless to say, I have a 101 questions that have been left unanswered.

She suggested I test again in three months, so I did test again in August and results show the same but stable (no change to May's testing). I was told I could wait another three months and test again or test and use another lab?? I don't understand these tests! Why isn't it just black or white??!! Someone please help me and give me some information if this has happened to anyone else?? I don't even know if I am being clear here?...Thank you for any help you can give me.","September 10, 2013 at 12:00 pm",1 Reply,"About VKATH

forrestbb,https://www.inspire.com/m/forrestbb/,"hi,

A person who perfomed oral and orally anal on me took poppers and I didn'tn know about them. Aftewards and into the next few weeks my rectum is tender sore especially only when passing bm. the f1st wk or so there was a pink tender rash like on my penins tip. but since has seem to recover heal torwardnoral and no more slight pain discomfort wheafter uninating. I was afraid I had developed hemeroids and the doctor prescribed prep H. I tried it externally but didn't have a substantial effect. I called the advice nurse this2nd week and she said to try the internal supositories. I'm on day 2 of 7 per the box instructions. it has seemed to relieve the itching and since yesterday it doesn't seem as sore.

I had emailed the doctor on the subject but he didn't answer on the subject . I've replied to him to and as per my own research in that if the person I was with used poppers and put his toungue on me or in me, It could chemically burn the skin. That is exactly what I fear has happened.

My next step is to how do and with what solution. lotion of sorts do I need to treat and repair my skin on penis tip and rectum? is the prep h wrong? I was thinking I could use a water based solution to rinse with like I did for my nose after a accident years ago. so far the water rinse seems to help.

I in the interim, intend on further sti testing, but am seeking your adice since I'm not getting it quick enough from my doctor at Kaiser.

You advice is welcome despite my embarrasement and regret of ever encountering someone and their use of poppers. Now I know how dangerous they are and how irresponsible their use can be.


Thanks for your support and help,

We are the team behind this site. We feel very fortunate to be able to work on a project that can make a real difference in helping people to live their lives happily.

Inspire was created in 2005 by a group of friends. We were each dealing with important medical issues in our families, and we found that while the Internet was a useful source for authoritative medical information, it was not a safe, welcoming place for us to find support.

We created Inspire to change all that. We envisioned a place where we as patients, caregivers, family and friends could support one another, and where we could do so in a safe, secure, privacy-protected environment.

We are dedicated to building the best online health communities possible. Like our community members, all of us have faced health challenges of our own - and we know from personal experience how valuable the support and encouragement of others can be.

Our tagline, 'Together We're Better', is at the heart of what we do."

AddisonMarie99,https://www.inspire.com/m/AddisonMarie99/,"Hi, 2 weeks ago I got diagnosed with HPV because a nurse noticed I had genital warts. That day she put some sort of acid treatment on them and then a week later I had the same treatment done. I think I'm going to get the rest surgically removed because I want to get this over with sooooo badly.

My main concerns are that I may have passed on genital warts to my boyfriend. We were having unprotected sex for a few weeks before I knew that the bumps were warts (I was dumb and assumed that they were razor burns). Unlike me he has a great immune system because a few times I've gotten a fever/flu and never got him sick even though we would sleepover together. I read somewhere that 2/3 of people who come in contact with active warts get them themselves. I'm hoping that since he has a good immune system and just got his first dose of the gardasil vaccine that he won't have an outbreak like me but I am so scared. Do you think I am being overly optimistic in thinking that he won't have an outbreak?

Also when the CDC says that you can ""clear"" the virus after one to two years does that mean that the virus is just dormant and you could get another outbreak if your immune system weakens or does it mean that the virus will not come back again?

Thanks for any input!","June 17, 2013 at 8:34 pm",2 Replies,"About AddisonMarie99

bonzoboy2013,https://www.inspire.com/m/bonzoboy2013/,"HerpV is clinically the most advanced therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of genital herpes
•HerpV contains Agenus' QS-21 Stimulon®* adjuvant currently being studied in 17 other clinical programs

LEXINGTON, Mass., Feb. 27, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agenus Inc. (Nasdaq:AGEN), a developer of therapeutic vaccines for cancer and infectious diseases, today announced it has completed patient screening in its Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, multicenter study for HerpV, a recombinant ""off-the-shelf"" therapeutic vaccine candidate for the treatment of genital herpes in herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) positive patients. HerpV contains Agenus' QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant (QS-21 Stimulon).

The Phase 2 study (designated as protocol C-400-02) has screened over 100 HSV-2 positive subjects and enrollment has been closed. The study will test the biological efficacy of HerpV as measured by effect on genital viral shedding after three injections of the therapeutic vaccine. A booster injection of HerpV will be given at six months after treatment to evaluate the potential durability of treatment effect.

The HerpV Phase 2 study has been supported by leading clinical experts in the field who have expressed that a reduction in viral shedding could translate into clinical benefit. A therapeutic vaccine to treat HSV-2 infected patients has the potential to provide a major paradigm shift in the treatment of this infection as well as provide significant quality of life benefits.

Agenus' QS-21 Stimulon is a novel adjuvant that is incorporated into 17 vaccines currently in clinical development, including four GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Phase 3 programs. Results from GSK's Phase 3 trials using MAGE-A3 cancer immunotherapeutic vaccines in lung cancer and melanoma, which incorporate QS-21 Stimulon, are anticipated this year.

About Heat Shock Protein Platform (HSP) and Recombinant Series HerpV

HerpV is a recombinant therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of genital herpes, which is caused by the herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2). The vaccine is based on Agenus' HSP platform technology, and contains Agenus' proprietary QS-21 Stimulon. HerpV consists of recombinant human heat shock protein-70 complexed with 32 distinct 35-mer synthetic peptides from the HSV-2 proteome. This broad spectrum of herpes antigens is intended to allow for more accurate immune targeting and surveillance, reducing the likelihood of immune escape. Further, the diversity of antigens in HerpV increases the chance of providing efficacy for a wide segment of the patient population.

In a four-arm, Phase 1 study, 35 HSV-2 seropositive patients received HerpV (designated in the study as AG-707 plus QS-21), AG-707, QS-21 alone, or placebo. Patients received three treatments at two-week intervals. The vaccine was generally well tolerated, with injection site pain as the most common reported adverse event.

In the Phase 1 study, all patients who were evaluable for immune response and received HerpV showed a statistically significant CD4+ T cell response (100%; 7/7) to HSV-2 antigens as detected by IFNγ Elispot, and the majority of those patients demonstrated a CD8+ T cell response (75%; 6/8). This study was published in the scientific journal Vaccine.

About HSV-2

About one in six Americans (16.2 percent) between the ages of 14 and 49 is infected with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http://www.cdc.gov/std/Herpes/STDFact-Herpes.htm). Herpes is the fastest growing STD in America and experts predict that one in four Americans will contract an STD sometime in their life. Since two thirds of the population that gets herpes is age 25 or younger, it is a real health threat to society. HSV-2 is a lifelong and incurable infection that can cause recurrent and painful genital sores.

About Agenus' QS-21 Stimulon® Adjuvant

Agenus' flagship adjuvant, QS-21 Stimulon, is a saponin extracted from the bark of the Quillaja saponaria tree, also known as the soap bark tree or Soapbark, an evergreen tree native to warm temperate central Chile. Agenus' QS-21 Stimulon has become a key component in the development of investigational preventive vaccine formulations across a wide variety of infectious diseases, and appears to be essential for several investigational therapeutic vaccines intended to treat cancer and degenerative disorders. QS-21 Stimulon has been widely studied in clinical development and tens of thousands of patients have received vaccines containing the adjuvant. QS-21 Stimulon is being studied in clinical trials for approximately 17 vaccine indications and include GSK's Phase 3 vaccine programs for RTS,S for malaria, MAGE-A3 cancer immunotherapeutic for non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma and HZ/su for shingles. In addition, Janssen's QS-21 Stimulon-containing vaccine candidate is in Phase 2 trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

RosieB86,https://www.inspire.com/m/RosieB86/,"Hi there,

I was diagnosed lately with Low Risk Genital Warts and want to find out as much information as possible with the hope to one day be sure that I am disease free (I really hope this is not a life long issue or even more than a couple of years).

I've spent the last few days doing as much research as I could and have sent emails to many people and organisations with a list of questions. Some have responded some have not. For now I will show a summary of what I found out.

1. On testing of low risk HPV
- There is a low risk test called Diagene Probe A. Not commonly used but is out there. Your doc can order it on a pap test.
-A low-risk HPV DNA test does exist but there are no clinical indications nor recommendations for its use.
- There is no test as what is the point of testing when most people would be positive.
2. On the likelihood of clearing the virus.
- If you do not smoke, have AIDS/HIV or transplanted organs your body has an excellent chance of clearing the HPV. Whilst this cant be 100% confirmed that this happens it is a very high likelihood that the virus clears and remains gone.
- In 90% of cases, the body naturally clears an HPV infection within two years. This means that a person is no longer infected with HPV. If you were to test negative for low-risk HPV and later had another episode of genital warts, this would be caused by a new infection. It would not be from your original infection since your body had already cleared that infection naturally.

3. On the rates of recurrence
- It is hard to distinguish between reoccurrence and reinfection. Reoccurrence can happen under extreme stress or hospitalisation but women do not usually have reoccurrence's.
-The idea of “re-occurring” outbreaks, is an old one. Now it is thought that rather than re-occurring outbreaks, most people experience re-infection. (The only time this is different is if the individual is living with a compromised immune system in which case re-occurrence is more likely). Often people who have one occasion of genital warts, never have another one.
- Another source quotes that they generally re-occur after 3 months.

4. On what the likelihood is of getting rid of warts for several years and then them coming back in pregnancy
- Less than10%.
6. On telling partners current and subsequent about infection
- Persons with genital warts should inform current sex partner(s) because the warts can be transmitted to other partners. In addition, they should refrain from sexual activity until the warts are gone or removed. It is not known how long a person remains contagious after warts are treated. It is also unclear whether informing subsequent sex partners about a past diagnosis of genital warts is beneficial to the health of those partners.
-until we have a test for men, it is not morally imperative that you tell anyone you have had HPV. that is a silly idea - like telling men that you menstruate.... totally uninformative and just puts you in a powerless position...
- If you are close enough to get intimate with someone you should be close enough to tell them something like that.

I will update once I have more info but PLEASE let me know your thoughts on the above.

never113,https://www.inspire.com/m/never113/,"I'm a 55 years old and married for nearly 35 years. My husband has been the only partner I’ve slept with. In the month of Feb 2011, I received anonymous phone call at work of my husband having an affair with a co-worker. I confronted him and he was in denial. Well, because I’m a person of faith I moved forward and left things in God hands. A year later I was due for an annual pap smear. I’ve always had normal Pap smear and was devastating once the doctor called and gave me the bad news of abnormal pap smear and high risk HPV. My first reaction was my husband gave me a sexual transmitted disease.
In Feb of 2013 I had the follow up Pap smear repeated and the results report read: fragments of superficial squamous epithelial cellular changes and consistent with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. LSIL,MILD DYSPASIA/HPV EFFECT CIN 1. Due to this test the doctor performed a biopsy and again detected HPV high risk and precancerous cell. I now have to repeat the test every six months. My follow test is in a couple of weeks.
I was glad when Michael Douglas came out to the public and announced information on his throat cancer due to HPV. But, then sad when sudden the news was no longer news anymore to the public. I hope that in the short period of his announcement it raised awareness. It’s great for someone so well known to the public like him has mentioned that HPV can cause cancer in men. I'm sick of hearing about how it's only a woman's problem. Men should take responsibility for their action. Specially, when their wives are faithful and have only been with him.","July 29, 2013 at 9:11 am",1 Reply,"About never113

Beautiful girl on the outside and inside but we haven't had any sexual relations for obvious reasons. She is currently taking Gleevec for her condition. It appears that if she acquires hsv -2 , anti viral medication such as valacyclovir or acyclovir, etc would not interact with her current medication but we are obviously worried about what it coulld/would do to her condition. Would it worsen, would it affect her counts? would she just experience an hsv outbreak more frequently than a regular person? Her last CD4+ count was 320 cells/mm. I don't know if her acquiring hsv would have anything to do with this. Her last tests show her hematology panel is stable but not the marrow yet. she will have those reults in days.

RosieB86,https://www.inspire.com/m/RosieB86/,"Hi All,

Im really hoping someone can help me. I went to the GUM clinic last week to get my very first smear and because I had a bump down there.

The whole time I was thinking it couldn't possibly be warts as I have only had 4 partners in 10 years and only one of them was a one night stand (7 years ago). Low and behold the doctor confirmed by worst fears. I don't think anything before has made me so stressed or upset in my whole life. I used to make a joke about my ex's warts on his hands now I have them on my down below bits. Since last week there has barely been more than 10 minutes where I haven't thought about it! I cry myself to sleep at nite and have been trying to hide tears in work. Im sure my boss knows something is up.

Its not so much the physical side of it that is making me worried it is the emotional side. As I am 27 I have been starting to worry already about finding the right man and settling down. At this stage I think I can fully take that out of the equation as that probably will now never happen. Its also the fact that I have been so unlucky for someone with what I think is a small amount of previous partners.

I called a specialist based here in Ireland who told me that I was stressing over nothing really. He said that 25% of people my age get the genital warts strain of HPV but only 1% show the symptoms. By my calculations this means that I am so unlucky that I am 2.5 out of 1000 people who get actual warts. I must have done something bad in a past life. He also said that 90% of people who get hpv clear the virus in 2 years but from reading online this doesn't seem to be a foregone conclusion.

My questions are as follows:
1. Has anybody actually any proof that the virus clears and therefore you cant infect anyone?
2. Can you pass it on even after a long outbreak free time period?
3. Is there tests you can take to prove to partners etc. that there is no detectable HPV in your system?
4. Is there any stage where you don't need to tell partners?
5. Is there any statistics in relation to the re-occurrence of warts? ie percentage of people who never have a breakout again?
6. For those in a situation such as me what is the general reaction from men when you tell them?
7. Should I now get the HPV vaccine?

I would be so grateful if people could provide me with there honest answers and not try sugarcoat it which I think doctors do a lot.
I do wonder why when HPV is apparently so prevelant there is not more conclusive and clear information on it. It seems to me like something which needs more research as I would imagine that there is a large proportion of people like me who feel like they could slip into a deep depression.

Thanks in advance.","August 1, 2013 at 12:50 pm",0 Replies,"About RosieB86

I sometimes wish I can do something to take it away. They say it supposed to go away on its own but other times it doesn't and turn into something much worse. I don't want to have this disease anymore. I also don't want it to pass on to the guy.

Has anyone ever been pregnant with hpv or another std?? How did it work out? Did the baby get infected? Can you get pregnant knowing you have this hpv disease or another one??

I was pregnant with child at 22 or 23 but decided to get an abortion because I felt I wasn't ready for a baby. I didn't want to be a single mom. It scares me to be a single mom because I seen my mom raise 5 kids by herself with no family support or our fathers being in the picture. She also had to work 2 jobs half the time just to support us all. I don't want to go through that at all. I always imagined that the father would be in the baby's life. You know spend time with the baby have child and father day or have family day sometimes. I want someone that wants to be in their kids life not someone that I have to force to be in the baby's life. When I told the guy he's the baby's father he told me that he wants nothing to do with the baby and if we went to court he will sign over his rights and if he was single he would take care of it. I really wanted to slap and punch him for saying that to me over the phone. It shouldn't matter if you taken or not take care of your kids either way. It's your responsibility as well as mine. How can he say that to the mother of his child? And it was mine and his first baby. How can a guy be such an asshole and not want to be apart of his child's life? It really broke my heart when he said that to me over the phone. It totally mess me up I couldn't hold anything down. I had a nervous breakdown. Our baby would have been at least 7 years old right now in December 1st. The sad part is I didn't think I would regret it years down the road when I'm 30 years old and wanting a baby. I recall saying to one of my girlfriend's in my early 20s that I felt like I wanted a baby but I wasn't seeing anyone yet. I don't remember if I said it before I got pregnant or after. I'm thinking I said it before though. I sometimes find myself imagining walking in the park with the baby or going to kid events with family and friends. I also get sad and cry when I'm talking about it with my mom. She feels that I would have been a good mom because the way I am with my neice when she is in town with sister. My now 3 year old niece would have a little cousin to play with. My mom is glad that I want to try to have another baby. She's all smiles about it.

I'm here to meet other people that know what I'm going through.

I have mild HPV. I have had It since 01/12/07. I was diagnosed at 24. I had the Colposcopy on 01/24/07. I had 1 abnormal pap in 01/07. My past 4 pap smears came back normal 07/07-01/09. I also took the Gardasil vaccine. It made 8 years this year that I have this sickness. I take my health seriously now. If you find out you have cancer because of this virus or another cancer fight it to the fullest.

I just found out on 4-16-14 that I have schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. I was also in the hospital for a really bad cold. I can't believe I have this. It's really scary to know not only do I have hpv for a couple of years. Now I have these other 2 sickness as well. I'm just taking it one day at a time. I really need to find some support about these sickness. I never in my life have I ever been this sick. I'm thinking of going to the library to get some books on my illnesses.

Don't judge a book by it's cover. I like this saying. It's like saying don't judge someone if you don't know anything about them.

Actions speak louder than words. I really like this saying. It's like saying prove to me how you really care about me."

Jer_,https://www.inspire.com/m/Jer_/,"I have been an athlete all my life. I slowed down significantly from 2003 until now. During this slowdown period, I've had three major surgeries due to chronic illness. 1) nasal polypectomy due to acute rhinitis 2) total thyroidectomy due to papillary carcinoma 3) abdominal perineal resection with permanent colostomy due to adenocarcinoma in the rectum. Tonight, I've sat here and thought about everything that I've done over the past decade. The slowdown was due to going back to school in order to finish my degree when it comes to being active. I still had goals, but the goals seemed to have played a role with my health. I went from working at a job that was non-stop to working a job where I was sedentary all....day...long! Out of all of these health problems I've had over the years (2003, 2009, 2013), I've come out, with God's grace, on the better end. I was told I have a 30% chance of the nasal polyps coming back, less than 1% chance of Thyroid Cancer coming back, and a 20% chance of rectal cancer recurrence. Tonight, I've made a goal to get back to physical activity, even possibly becoming competitive once again (I competed in bodybuilding, powerlifting, and personal trained). I will strive to live as healthy as I possibly can to know within my self that I've done everything I can to stay healthy for the rest of my life. I want/need to give back to others and say, ""I will be here for you and we will get you through anything you set your mind to!"" I love each and every person here and who I cross paths with, no matter our individual perspectives on life. We are here with a purpose and we should be driven to achieve the purpose we are here for! Each of us has a destination and I will be here to do everything I can to reach my own as well as walk by others to achieve his/hers! Lets do this people! Get on this train and lets make a difference in this world! Lets find a way to defeat the exact things that has brought us all together, horrible diseases! Let hate one thing and one thing only, disease! Lets love one another and do and say only the things that will propel each other to the top!

SOSErick,https://www.inspire.com/m/SOSErick/,"Hi everybody!

First off-My name is Erick. I'm 22. I live with my younger brother, he's 21.

I have Genital Warts.
How long have you had warts on your Male Genitals?
-I have had them for 11-months now. I'm certain I got this strain of HPV last year, May 2012.

How did you get Genital Warts?
-From having Promiscuous sex with a stranger, during a one night stand, without a condom.

Okay, did you have a lot of Promiscuous Sex?
-No, but I do know that Promiscuous Sex is why I have Genital Warts and how this all started.

How was your sex life before you knew you had Genital Warts?
-Very casual, if you can imagine that. I simply dated like an ordinary teen and young adult. Wore protection, had a couple girlfriends and then after a gap in my sex life,of 4 months, I have a one night stand and one thing leads to the other, which leads me to here-right now.



How long after you had your one night stand, May 2012, in which you contracted your HPV, did you realize you had Genital Warts?
-2-month's after May.

Did you have sex with any new partners in-between the time of your one night stand and the time of realizing-""you are growing warts on your Penis""?
-Thankfully, no. I would be heavy with guilt if i knew i did.

Do you know what type of HPV strain you carry?
-No and Truthfully, I have no idea were to even start with information like that or the benefits of having such information!

Are you a Male or Female?
-I'm a Male. I want to make that clear for readers. Who know's how many people this post can benefit. I'm hoping to truthfully get a grip on my life again and help everyone who needs it, like I do, Man or Women-through making this post! I with multiple people's integrity I can gather enough information to Clear up my Warts and keep it that way.



What is your main objective through these post's?
-In all honesty, I want to Naturally eliminate my Genital Warts.

How much do you know about Wart Treatment?
-Not enough. That's how I personally feel about it.

Have you seen a Dr?
-Yes, The topical creams did not work for my warts.

Have you tried anything other then Dr. Recommended Topical Creams?
-Yes, actually i have.

Would you like to share?
-No, I don't think anyone would in my position. I need Help and I know other people do as well. For people's sake and my own. I will share what I have tried.

What did you try besides surgery and Dr. Recommended Creams?
-I did mild Research on Genital Warts online and how to ""cure"" them naturally, I say this with really low self esteem, as I've purchased a scam from somebody, and then found myself feeling even worse.","April 20, 2013 at 3:23 am",1 Reply,"About SOSErick

I'm 22 year's old. I live with my little brother here in California. He's 21.

I joined this website because I need answers. I'm suffering. HPV is ruining my life breaking my mental stability. My anxiety get's very high because of my warts, I see bad thoughts in my mind and I have panic attacks. All because of my Genital Warts.

I've had warts on my male genitals for 11-months now. It's felt actually felt much longer-although my mental state of well being is being crushed under the weight of my warts. Which would explain why it seems longer.

I believe that I have warts growing in my mouth, now, inside, on my bottom lip. They're very tiny but come in clusters. Bottom Line, I'm not sure yet and I'm only acting now because of one reason.

I Would Never want to infect someone else. The fear of infecting my brother has brought me here to creating this profile and being so outspoken with such a hidden subject in my life.

You must understand. Having HPV is my biggest secret, Biggest fear, In my life for the past 11months.

I'm so disgusted with myself. I see my self as a walking, living corpse rotting with Warts. I feel like a walking Disease. My anxiety causes me to over compensate for my suffering and I'm finding myself scratching my skin and now i have to monitor that because I keep bleeding from the scratching.

I believe it's from all the anxiety build up I have. I keep scratching my chest, and neck and it's making me bleed. I'm suffering terribly, and silently."
JohnNovack,https://www.inspire.com/m/JohnNovack/,"Dear members,

We at Inspire are pleased to bring you the latest in a series of Q&A interviews with people who are making contributions to helping patients and caregivers worldwide. The people in this Q&A series may not be affected by, or focus on, the same type of disease or condition that affects you, but we hope you find the interviews interesting and insightful. We post these interviews in a question-and-answer format in my Inspire Journal here as a news feature for Inspire group members across our many support communities.

Deanna Attai, MD is a Burbank, CA surgeon whose practice focuses exclusively on the care of patients with benign and malignant breast conditions. She is heavily involved in cancer- and health-related discussions on social media sites, and is best known online as co-moderator for Breast Cancer Social Media–a patient-focused breast cancer support group on Twitter. (There are a number of members of the Inspire Advanced Breast Cancer Support Community who are part of the BCSM Twitter chat.)
Attai is on the board of directors of the American Society of Breast Surgeons.

Inspire: You are very aware that more patients are going online to try to manage their medical conditions, or those of loved ones. What do you think drives them?

Attai: One reason that patients turn to online sources for information and support is that their physician may not spend enough time with them for them to have a good understanding of their condition and treatment options, which certainly can be frustrating. Sometimes it's just to confirm that what their physician told them is a reasonable and standard option.

Inspire: How do you think patients can best communicate what they’ve learned from online research to their clinicians?

Attai: I think that if a patient has obtained information about their condition from an online source, and if it differs from what was discussed with their physician, they should bring that information to the attention of their physician. Maybe it was not discussed initially because it does not apply to the patient's individual case. But sometimes a patient may come across some information that their physician did not consider or was not aware of.

Inspire: I suspect many physicians would consider all the time and effort you put into Breast Cancer Social Media and think that it's not worth your time. I saw you write in an online column recently that ""the hours (being a surgeon) are incredibly long, and my life is never my own."" So, how does all this online patient-related work benefit you?

Attai: Especially now, all physicians are struggling with the ""not enough hours in a day"" syndrome. For me, being involved with social media has become an integral part of my practice. It allows me to reach out to a much larger group of patients than I could ever see in my daily practice. And it also allows me to educate my existing patients on an ongoing basis. I don't think any patient has made an appointment for a consultation because I'm on Twitter or Facebook. However, I think that the patients who do see me appreciate that they can have some additional contact and education, even outside normal office hours.

Inspire: How does it benefit you as a clinician?

Attai: For me personally, I've learned so much from the Breast Cancer Social Media participants. Often people will share details about their treatments and how it really affects them in a more open and honest way online compared to in person--my participation in the support group chats has given me more insights into what my patients are really going through, and has allowed me to have a better understanding of their concerns and fears. And more understanding means that I can take better care of my patients.

Inspire: It seems we're in the early stages of the ""e-patient,"" particularly related to how patients leverage technology and online resources to help manage their own illnesses. What do you see as the highest and best use of healthcare social media?

Attai: There are many forms of healthcare social media and I don't know what is considered the ""best."" Honestly, I think that answer is different for everyone. Being an e-patient means so much more than reviewing message boards. It means that you are truly engaged in your care. I don't think this is new, but what is new is that more and more physicians are embracing this and recognizing that a partnership with their patients actually benefits both the patient and the physician.

Inspire: What advice would you give to patients who are reluctant to discuss with their physicians information that the patients got online, through a clinical site or an online community?

Attai: I would say if your physician is not willing to discuss outside information, you might want to consider getting another physician. While most of the time when a patient brings me information from an online or other source, it's something we've either discussed or is not relevant to their care, there are times when the information is something that was not considered, and may or may not be of benefit to the patient. Whether or not the information is really relevant to their care almost doesn't matter--the patient has questions and needs answers. It's up to the patient to get guidance so that they can make decisions right for them. It's the patient's responsibility to speak up, and it's the physician's responsibility to listen.

Inspire: How exactly do you react to your patients who want to talk with you about online clinical information?

Attai: I always end my consults with the phrase, ""Call me if you have any questions. Write down your questions and call me.” And patients do call.

Inspire: What do they ask?

Attai: Sometimes it's just for clarification, sometimes it's to discuss something they've read about and want to know if it applies to their case. If a patient has unanswered questions or lingering doubts going into treatment or surgery, they will not be happy with the outcome. I don't have any patient that is truly comfortable with the idea of undergoing surgery for their breast cancer. But I encourage them to ask all the questions they need so that they understand the treatment options and feel that they have made the decision that is best for them.

Inspire: What kind of changes have you seen in the survivors who participate regularly in the BCSM weekly chats on Twitter?

Attai: It does seem that over time, the women in the chat have become more open about asking questions and simply standing up for themselves. The group is so supportive and provides such a safe environment for discussion that even patients that are new to the chat don't take long to start speaking up and either asking questions, asking for help, or sharing their experiences so that they may help others.

Inspire: What is your long-term objective is for BCSM?

Attai: I have many hopes and dreams for BCSM! But the main one is that we can expand our outreach beyond Twitter. While the community has grown tremendously, it is a small percentage of patients, caregivers, and practitioners that are active on Twitter. We have to find ways to reach the larger community of breast cancer patients. And I am confident that we will!

Lindsey Miller, 27, of California, has pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer, a rare and chronic disease. She was diagnosed in October 2010, just after she turned 25. Through social media she became well known as the young woman who made a video to ask actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, on a date. She did so in late 2011 after seeing Gordon-Levitt in “50/50,” a movie about a young man with cancer.

The 38-second YouTube video got over 400,000 views, surprising Miller, and thrusting her into a media spotlight. The unexpected wave of publicity has prompted Miller to take on a role to raise awareness about pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer, and to speak out for people with rare diseases. To read an article about the YouTube viral video and its aftermath, click here.

Miller blogs at i am a liver.

(Inspire has created an online support group for people affected by pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, often called PNET. Inspire created the group in partnership with six advocacy and professional organizations that serve the PNET patient community. Click here to learn more about the Inspire PNET Support Community. )

Inspire: You call your blog, “i am a liver.” Describe what you mean as a ""liver.""

Miller: The most common words terms that are used to describe people who have or have had cancer are “patient” or “survivor.” You don’t hear as often of people having chronic cancer--at least, I don’t. I am both a patient and a survivor, but I don’t want to call myself a patient forever because that sounds exhausting. And I don’t necessary feel comfortable with the term “survivor” either. I have been through chemo and surgery, and while I’ve survived through them, there’s no end in sight, so I don’t attach the same meaning to saying that I’m a survivor. So I prefer to say I’m a “liver,” as I’m just living my life with disease.

Inspire: It seems that you can identify with different communities of people affected by disease--cancer, rare disease, and chronic disease.

Miller: And also I’m in the young adult category of people with cancer. There are quite a few young adults getting diagnosed with cancer but it’s still not as common. When I was diagnosed I wanted to connect with other young adults who have cancer, and while I’m still in a young adult cancer support group, and find value in that, I still feel I need to talk to people who have chronic cancer, to talk to people who know what it’s like not to just fight the battle and be done, who are more “running the marathon,” like I am.

Inspire: How specifically has connecting with people, in person and through social networks, with a disease like yours helped you?

Miller: If you get diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma or non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma there are protocols that doctors follow. For a lot of more common cancers that’s the case as well. For what I have, it’s more like I go to see my doctors and they rattle off 10 different things I could do right now. It’s just really hard to know what to do first, so going online and researching different treatments and connecting with other people who have what I have and hearing what they’ve done is helpful to see. For example, one of my treatment options was a liver transplant. When I was considering getting on the transplant list, I was connected with someone who has what I have and who got a liver transplant. So, I had the opportunity to talk with him about the process and about how he feels now.

Inspire: You’re out there living your disease, if you will, in a public manner now, though your blog and Twitter and other channels. Do you have any discomfort with you becoming too identified with your disease, so that you want to be “just Lindsey” instead of “liver Lindsey?”

Miller: I would say that there’s enough balance in my life so that it’s OK. There are still people in my life who don’t know I have cancer and there are a lot who do. I went to a New Year’s party, and the host knew I had cancer, but the others there didn’t. There are enough situations like that where I can be “just Lindsey.” For better or worse--probably worse--it affects everything I do. For example I just graduated from graduate school and people ask me if I’ve gotten a job. I’m likely heading toward another active phase in my treatment so I may not be able to get a job right away. Explaining that to people is awkward (laughs). So, whether or not I want to be “just Lindsey” sometimes, it’s hard.

Inspire: Why do you think the Joseph Gordon Levitt video got the attention that it did? Though you didn’t get to have that cup of coffee with him, at least not yet, the video did help raise attention about pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer. What has been the biggest surprise of that experience, with regard to others with cancer?

Miller: I don’t really know why it got that much attention (laughs). I guess it got seen by the right people. It got posted on Reddit and I guess people on Reddit like a certain thing and my video was something they liked. I also like to think my honesty touched people, and then the people who took the time to click the link on the blog could see that I wasn’t just looking for attention but that I was sincerely going through this cancer thing and making this video came up as a way to let everyone know that I have cancer.

Inspire: Being public about having the disease that you have is clearly important to you. What kind of feedback have you gotten from people with serious diseases?

Miller: I get a lot of emails from people who say, “Wow, that video is so great. I wish I had the guts to do that,” and it’s kind of funny, because probably two years ago at this time, I would have been wishing for the guts to do that also.

miss_brat,https://www.inspire.com/m/miss_brat/,"I was diagnoised with high risk HPV a few months ago and my colposcopy is scheduled for next week! I have to say that this is the scariest thing that I have ever had to deal with but it is nice to know that I am not alone! Once my gyno gave me this new's I began researching all the questions I had, online and found some very helpful information as well as some very scary information! The internet is full of so many conflicting stories that It is very hard to know, ""what and who to believe"", so my hope in posting this is to find the right answer's being that we are all, ""in this together""! I am a mother of two and I adore my children and one of my biggest fears is, can either one of my children get this monster by simply sipping off of a drink that I had, or anything along that line? I would be so devestated if I found out I infected my innocent children with this monster not even knowing it! As I said before, there are so many conflicting stories on the internet about this, and I don't know what to believe! Someone please shed some light on this for me, so that I can sleep at night!

bejess,https://www.inspire.com/m/bejess/,"Ok I was first told I had cervial cancer. I questioned that. I had a total hystorectamie done in 2007. How can i have cervical cancer when my cervix was removed. so went to a specalist. found out it was HPV. stages 1 and 2..so i opted to have it laser removed. doc said it is a simple surgery quick recovery. ok so surgery was nov 5, it is now nov 28 I am still having issues. doc would not let me use the burn cream. he said he had to laser so much and had to laser all the way in. 90% of my inner vagina was lasered. I am having saveer cramping, stabbing pains and if i do much of anything i feel like i just peed myself. idk what is going on. oh and if i do my normal routine, before surgery, i loose all strength. and the cramping doubles me over. the only pain med i am taking is ibprofin 800mg.
does anyone have any ideas or know what could be going on.

Dear members,
A healthcare journalist with ABCNews.com contacted us today seeking help in researching an HIV-related article. She is hoping to interview by phone an Inspire member who has used the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test.

She wrote us that OraQuick ""is the HIV home test that the FDA approved last July and that hit store shelves last month. It’s the first HIV home test that gives results right in the home in 20 minutes and doesn’t require a user to call in for results. Ideally, I’d like someone who might have been unaware of their positive status before taking this test at home. . .The person would be assured anonymity. I do not need to use their name, or provide any other identifying details.""

If you fit the profile of what the writer is seeking, and you'd be willing to be interviewed by phone, please email me at john@inspire.com by this Friday, Nov. 30, 10 a.m. EST. I'll put you in contact right away with the writer. PLEASE include a phone number when responding, and include ""Inspire"" in the subject line of your email. Your contact information will not be shared with anyone other than the reporter, and it will not be stored.

Thanks for being Inspire members.

bb2012,https://www.inspire.com/m/bb2012/,"I got diagnosed with high risk hpv and shared the news with my boyfriend of a few months. Of course, he freaked out and went in to the dr for a check-up. Then he tells me he's been diagnosed with chlamydia. At this point, I call my dr immediately so get antibiotics, 'cause I'm thinking about how untreated chlamydia can lead to PID & infertility. That really freaks me out. I realized recently that I really want children.

Then my next thought was, where did the chlamydia come from? I got an STI screen before my boyfriend and I had sex. We've been faithful to each other. So, given that it tends to show no symptoms, it probably came from someone he had sex with. If he wasn't so loving and supportive, this information would have thrown me off the edge. He is a sexually responsible man and we talked a lot about safe sex before we did it.

It's the first time in my life that I've gotten an STI and it's made me feel ashamed. At the same time, I know I need to deal with these feelings so that I can be able to have a safe, healthy sex life with my committed partner.

I appreciate everyone in cyberspace who's shared their story. I hope somebody reading mine will take comfort--you are not alone!","July 23, 2012 at 12:40 am",0 Replies,"About bb2012

bb2012,https://www.inspire.com/m/bb2012/,"The past week of my life has been full of stress & anxiety. Luckily, I've had wonderful support from a close friend as well as my boyfriend of a few months. I'm very grateful for everyone sharing their experiences online. It's so reassuring to know I'm not alone! So I'd like to share my experience with others.

I had an abnormal pap early in the year, the repeat pap was still abnormal and showed high risk hpv. I used protection most of the time--but didn't do so consistently. I learned my lessons but still feel guilty about poor choices I made during a stressful time in my life. I was often under the influence of alcohol & had poor self-esteem. Some years have gone by, and I've learned my lessons and made wiser choices. I'm finally in a stable relationship with the goal of marriage & kids. And now hpv appears. I feel guilty for exposing my boyfriend to it. But at least he had the Gardasil vaccine. I'm angry that I didn't get it when my dr suggested it some years ago. I don't know if it would have made a difference. But now I'm focusing on what I can do next. I'm getting a colposcopy in a few days. I'm increasing my exercise and continuing to eat healthy. Also looking at supplements and considering seeing a naturopathic dr. Cost would be my main barrier, but I will do everything I can to help my body fight this infection.","July 23, 2012 at 12:28 am",0 Replies,"About bb2012

Peace_hope,https://www.inspire.com/m/Peace_hope/,"Hi, I'm Amanda. I'm 21 and I was diagnosed with HPV, genital warts about 6 months ago. I contracted it when I was raped in June of 11 and how I contracted it has made it so hard to deal with. Every outbreak is a reminder of what happened and it makes me feel like I'm taking a step back in the work I've put forth in taking back my life.

I struggle to feel attractive when I have an outbreak, and my experience with partners hasn't been great till the most recent. My ex didn't talk to me for 2 days after the warts were found and that set the tone for how I thought it would be taken.

I'm greatly hoping to get people who know what this is like and get the insecurities, also information on what to expect with treatments and what to ask my dr about. That has been another struggle, a dr who will listen and take my worries seriously and give me the information I'm looking for.

Thank you for reading this novel.

JohnNovack,https://www.inspire.com/m/JohnNovack/,"Dear Inspire Community Members,

We at Inspire are pleased to bring you the latest in a series of Q&A interviews with people we feel are making contributions to helping patients worldwide. We are posting these interviews in a Q&A format in my Journal as a news feature for members of all communities on Inspire.

I recently interviewed Howard Luks, MD, who writes and speaks frequently on topics related to patient empowerment, improving physician/patient communication, and healthcare social media. Luks is a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, an associate professor of orthopedic surgery at New York Medical College, and also chief of sports medicine and arthroscopy serve at University Orthopedics, PC and Westchester Medical Center in New York. He blogs at http://www.howardluksmd.com/. One of his recent columns, written for physicians, was titled, The Risks of Not Participating in Healthcare and Social Media.

Inspire: How do you think patients can best communicate what they’ve learned from online research to their clinicians?

Luks: What I fully support and recommend is that my patients either email me any relevant information that they find that they think pertains to their case, and most certainly, to print out any interesting articles or data they may find, or any discussion threads they believe are relevant, and bring them to the office, so we can sit there and review them. I have two chairs sitting next to the computer screen in my office. One of for me, and one is for the patient. I believe that’s probably very rare.

Inspire: How about for patients of physicians who only have one chair in front of the computer, and who are disinclined to have those kinds of discussions with their patients?

Luks: While there are a number of physicians who choose to engage in this manner and are recognizing and appreciating the value proposition of digital media engagement, there are still a lot of physicians who are resisting this. So, patients have the opportunity to walk. Patients have the opportunity to seek out a physician who is willing to engage them, who is willing offer them a means of communicating with them digitally once the patient leaves the four walls of the physician’s office, so it extends the physician’s reach and availability well beyond the realm of their office space.

Inspire: Patients do have choices, but wouldn’t you agree that making that kind of change can be scary and difficult, especially for patients who are seriously ill, or who have rare diseases?

Luks: It can be difficult, absolutely. But if you’ve had a well-established and long relationship with your physician, then I think your physician will feel that too. And that patient has a much better chance of convincing that physician to engage, either with simply a Web site that is full of actionable and meaningful content, or to engage in social media, or through means of digital communications. So, the better your relationship, the better chance you have of convincing your physician to engage with you. Patients drive physician behavior. It’s well known in the medical device world, and I imagine that will transcend to the digital world as well in terms of communications, outreach and education.

Inspire: You’re considered an evangelist among physicians on the topic of healthcare social media, and you interact with fellow physicians at medical meetings and in online forums. How have you answered criticisms by physicians of patient empowerment through social networks and online research?

Luks: As recently as a year ago, they were different conversations than I have now. You’d get a lot of eyes rolling into the back of their heads, and a lot of skeptical looks, and they just didn’t believe you or understand you. They didn’t truly understand the world of social media, digital media, and most still don’t. Now, while many don’t understand the space, they do understand their relevance going forward is certainly at risk if they do not at least start their due diligence process.

Inspire: And what is the nature of those conversations now with physicians?

Luks: Now what I talk with physicians is that this is about relationships. I tell them that this is about stories. We treat patients. We don’t treat x-rays or MRI findings. So, I want to know as much about my patients, their disease and how it affects their quality of life, as I possibly can. And sometimes, the office environment for them is quite scary, and imposing, and they don’t remember what they wanted to ask, and it’s not until they are on their way home before they remember. And it’s very well known that patients forget about 75% or 80% of what they were told when they leave their physician’s office. So, first, I have cards and pads so they can write things down. Physicians are starting to realize that it helps us regain or recapture those relationships that older physicians had with their patients. They knew their patients. They knew their patients had a recent baby, or that they just bought a new house, that they moved, or they got a new job, or got a puppy, or whatever. Having a relationship with your patient in that respect for some is special and meaningful. And I talk all the time about non-verbal cues and non-verbal communication. And that’s very important. I can tell a lot about how someone feels just by looking at them. But I can also learn a lot about them by what they have to say on either my Web site as part of a comment or testimonial, or on my Facebook or Twitter pages as well.

Inspire: Even so, many physicians are reluctant to become engaged in this manner, even a little bit.

Luks: True, a lot of them are fearful of the exposure and legal risk and also the time commitment, and thus, a perceived cost. The cost argument can be thrown out because patients are researching online. They’re researching and diagnosing themselves through WebMD and then they’re searching for physicians who have expertise in that particular area. If you choose not to engage, then I feel that is to ignore your own relevance as a healthcare practitioner.

Inspire: What you’re saying is that patients are online anyway, with or without your direction or consent?

Luks: Exactly. A lot of physicians believe that digital media is a passing fad. And during my talks now I frequently quote that whether you agree with this trend is not particularly relevant. It is occurring. It’s gaining an enormous amount of traction. It is growing by leaps and bounds. So, I’m not telling a physician to share with patients where he’s eating or what movie he’s at, or if he’s at a birthday party and eating chocolate cake. That’s what a lot of physicians think of the world of social media. And a little education goes a long way.","April 9, 2012 at 9:01 am",57 Replies,"About JohnNovack

ElizabethAnnB,https://www.inspire.com/m/ElizabethAnnB/,"I have been doing a ton of research on this topic because I was recently diagnosed with this horrible STD HPV. I also did a ton of research on it during nursing school. I am wondering people's real experiences with this virus. I spoke with two of my doctors and they both keep assuring me that it will go away and that 99% of people who come to their office have it once and don't get it again, unless they pick up another strain. i was prescribed Aldara. I have a couple small fleshy warts, nothing big, :knock on wood:. Anyway, my doctor's both told me that if someone is able to clear the virus and initiate an immune response to the virus and clear it, that is will not be tranmitted in the future. They both said that it takes time, but eventually, it will be so undetectable that I won't pass it to future partners. I mean my doctor swore to me that this was the case. I told her about things that I was reading online and she said not to listen to them because not much was known about HPV until more recent years. I want to believe her because well, that is a better ending to this nightmare. I am a nurse and I actually agree from a medical standpoint where this would be the case. I mean, this is even true with herpes. Once the body builds enough antibodies, the likelihood of ever having a breakout again decreases, even with herpes. Some people go 20 years without a breakout, and the difficulty with herpes is that the body can't build the appropriate immune response initially because the virus hides. This isn't true with HPV. It is not stored in the spine and is stored in the skin cells. I want to believe what she is saying because it makes sense, but I would like to hear from other people who have only had this early on and didn't have problems with it again and if they did have a history of the virus, did they ever infect a future partner after they rid themselves of the warts and time had passed? The last answer I am looking for is someone to be like...you have this forever! you are doomed and contagious and irresponsible in your sex life! So, please don't say anything like that. The most respectable guy I ever dated ended up being the one to give me this horrible nightmare of an STD. He supposedly did not know, I guess I will never know if that is really true or not, but it popped up right after we became intimate..I am just looking for some type of hope from others who have been in this situation.","April 10, 2012 at 6:58 pm",3 Replies,"About ElizabethAnnB

blondy_89,https://www.inspire.com/m/blondy_89/,"My ex and I broke up a couple days before I found out I had HPV. I told him the next day after I found out, he said he went to the doctors and he was clean and he didn’t give this to me. But I was done with him, I had done my part by being responsible and telling him what he had given me, knowingly or not.

I have not talked to him since; it has been two and a half weeks. Out of the blue he texted me last night. I don’t know why this has messed with me so much, but it has. This was what was said

Him: Hey, how are you?
Me: What do you want?
Him: To check on you?
Him: I’m sorry. Nvm.
Me: I still haven’t forgiven you
Him: Ok.

I have all of these emotions and I don’t know what to do. I want to tell him just to leave me alone and never talk to me again. We were friends before we started seeing each-other, and I think that’s what makes this harder for me. When we started seeing each-other things changed. He didn’t talk to me as much, started saying he was going to come over then never showing without a call or text. He was a huge a-hole. The only reason we made it as long as we did was because I was still trying to find my best friend that I had before. I think him being my first makes it hard too.

I just had to get this out.","March 19, 2012 at 11:30 am",5 Replies,"About blondy_89

On Friday February 24, 2012 I found out I had genital warts. I have only had one sexual partner so I knew where it came from. I have come a long way since I have found out, but the road ahead is still going to be a struggle. I am still working really hard to face the fact that yes, I have an STD. I am working hard on getting health and keeping my immune system up."
Penguin_Fluff,https://www.inspire.com/m/Penguin_Fluff/,"When you look up ""genital warts"" on google images, the results are nothing short of terrifying. Depending on the severity of the condition, it can leave a person mutilated. No one wants this to be their fate. I'm no exception.

I'm 20 years old and I've been sexually active for a couple years now. I started getting these tiny little bumps on my vulva a couple weeks ago, but I ignored them, assuming is was razor burn. However, shortly thereafter, the ceaseless itching ensued. A few days ago, the lumps became slightly more noticeable, which caught my attention enough for me to express my concerns to my boyfriend. After examining me, he calmly replied, ""Well, you'd better get it checked out...it makes me feel confident in our relationship that you can talk to me openly about these things."" So, once again, I tried not to worry about it for the time being. But just one day later, I couldn't ignore the itching any longer. I went to the bathroom to take care of it, and this surge of panic seized my entire body. The bumps were not only itchier, but more noticeable, confirming in my mind that I had genital warts.

I laid down in bed next to my boyfriend and started to cry. ""i'm pretty sure I have something,"" I whispered timidly, through stifled tears. I spent the next hour sobbing, terrified, in his arms.

I cried myself to sleep that night. When I woke up, I was crying. That afternoon, more crying. Driving home from an expensive doctor's visit (for the diagnosis ONLY, not the treatment) was similarly followed by a cascade of tears. Later that night, what do ya know? More crying. Needless to say, I was a wreck. I have a much better grip on myself today, but only because I'm over the initial shock of it.

Something that needs to be understood about my situation is that the community I live in is very conservative and tight-lipped about these things, which only adds to the fact that I am experiencing inexplicable guilt, humiliation, and anxiety. I am immensely ashamed of the possibility that I may have given my boyfriend the HPV virus, however unintentional. I feel like i failed in my responsibility as a sexually active adult to get vaccinated, tested, and use protection. I don't feel like an attractive person; in fact, I feel like I don't even deserve to have sex because who, in their right mind, would want to catch a virus that never goes away? Also, I don't have health insurance. (My dad dropped my from his policy when I was 19 and honestly, to my great regret, it hasn't been a huge priority till now.) Thus, I am left to navigate the seas of financial medical turmoil on my own, and I am hoping and PRAYING that Planned Parenthood and/or the county health department will have effective, affordable treatment options.

I feel incredibly lucky to have a boyfriend who wasn't even slightly judgmental of my plight, nor did he have the least bit of apprehension regarding my loyalty to him. He is willing to do whatever he can to provide physical and emotional support while I'm going through this. I couldn't ask for someone more wonderful and loving. (In truth, he's helping to keep me sane through this fiasco.)

Still...having genital warts is scary business. One of the greatest comforts, I feel, is knowing that others are experiencing the same thing. I'm sorry I rambled on forever and ever, and I don't mean to sound melodramatic, but I just wanted to get my story out there. If there is anyone who is willing to talk, I love you already. :)","March 18, 2012 at 12:19 pm",2 Replies,"About Penguin_Fluff

kelg81,https://www.inspire.com/m/kelg81/,"Hi. I've known I've had HPV for 8yrs now and for a long time I felt ok but I find myself hating myself for having it. I need to gain some clarity out of it.

I have the form of HPV that causes genital warts, not cancer. I first noticed the warts and had them promptly removed. Over the years, I've had no outbreak, but recently, about a year ago, I had unusual spotting and the doctor checked me out. He ended up having to do a biopsy on some abnormal cervical cells and told me it was HPV but not the cancer-causing kind. I can (and have been) dealing with this, but it seems like a dark cloud hanging over my head.

My thing is, when I become involved with a guy and I try to do the right thing and tell him I have HPV (to be responsible), how can I explain the virus to him? Like how it's transmitted? I know safe sex is better than unsafe, but I'm always worrying that I can still pass it on to someone with the use of a condom. Am I wrong? Right? What's my best bet in keeping a partner safe?

I've read that HPV sometimes clears on its own. How? I don't understand that.

I just need some help in learning how to not let this disease bring me down and paralyze me into not having a life.

Can anyone help?

Thanks in advance!

blondy_89,https://www.inspire.com/m/blondy_89/,"On Friday February 24, 2012 I found out I have genital warts. I have only had one sexual partner so I knew where it came from, when I confronted him about it, he said he was going to go to the doctors. He said the Doctor said he didn't have it. But all my research has come to the conclusion that there's no way he could know that because there is not test for it for guys, and since he was symptom free he concluded he did not have it.
I am still working really hard to face the fact that yes, I have an STD. These past days have been so emotional. I have only told my best friend, and she has been here for me, and I don't know what I would have done without her. I still don't think that I can tell the other loved ones in my life, I feel so embarrassed. It really doesn't help that no one liked him either. We were together for a year and 2 months, he had just broken if off with me a few days before I went to the doctors.
I do not have insurance, I am go to school full time and working 2 jobs just to make rent and gas money. Now I am going to have medical expenses that I can not afford. I know everything will work out, but right now I just feel so overwhelmed I don't know what to do, other than take it an hour at a time.

Kay246,https://www.inspire.com/m/Kay246/,"All of this happened fast and I am scared and looking for support. After a couple of abnormal paps and a colposcopy saying I am HPV positive and CNI, but they are not ruling out CNII or III. I am so nervous. I still don't understand fully why not ruling out CNII or CNIII really means. My gyno said she could not see everything in the colposcopy so she recommended the LEEP and she is hoping the LEEP will also cure me. I'm am very very scared. I understand that this is a common procedure and know people who have had it done, but I am very much hoping that this will work for me. I'm really terrified and feeling very much alone.

I just started seeing someone new a few months ago. Luckily we have not had sex yet, so I have not exposed him to the virus, but I just informed him about everything going on yesterday. I thought he should know about the HPV and the risks. I was also hoping for some support for the LEEP, but he seemed more concerned about the HPV and catching it from me. I am so very sad and feeling very very alone in this. I have not heard from him and I think its over. I am very depressed and I am terrified of never having a normal life again. The only encouraging thing I guess is that most people I have talked to what have had this done, have normal paps after the procedure but I'm so afraid of getting my hopes up. I continue to be disappointed by my results and by people.

thanks for listening and in advance for the support.","January 22, 2012 at 12:42 pm",1 Reply,"About Kay246

JohnNovack,https://www.inspire.com/m/JohnNovack/,"Dear readers,

We at Inspire are pleased to bring you the latest in a series of interviews with people making contributions to helping patients and caregivers worldwide. We are posting these interviews in a Q&A format in my Journal as a news feature for members of all communities on Inspire.

About a decade ago, a highly respected American Express financial planner, Susan Grant, realized with growing horror that she was losing her mind. The rare genetic disease FrontoTemporal Dementia (FTD) had begun to take hold.

FTD is a type of dementia, second in prevalence to Alzheimer’s disease. FTD accounts for as many early dementia sufferers as does Alzheimer's under age 65, and often appears in men and women as young as their 30s. The disease is sometimes called ""baby boomer dementia."" Despite her own worsening condition, Grant is working to raise awareness about FTD, particularly throughout the medical community, and to reduce the stigma associated with FTD.

Grant used online resources to research more symptoms of this rare disease in the very early stages. She participated, for eight years, in clinical trials at the Mayo Clinic, University of Pennsylvania, University of California, and at NIH. She now uses online resources to manage her condition and participates with her physicians on a treatment plan for medication usage.

Because of the lack of awareness for the disease and education on diagnosing the signs and symptoms, Grant spent the past three years creating the documentary film, Planning for Hope, Living with FrontoTemporal Disease.

The film was just completed and it features personal stories from six families, as well as researchers from University of Pennsylvania, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, and Mayo Clinic. Because of the implications of the disease striking younger people, the film’s producers also included insights from lawyers, and financial and estate planners.

I interviewed Grant by email exchanges and by phone. Excerpts of our conversation follow:

Inspire: You were managing investments of about $40 million, but you were forced to retire early from your financial advisor job because of FTD. That process of recognizing you were unable to continue in your job must have been terribly difficult.

Grant: Liability can make one pay way more attention to things. Yes, we were insured, but depending on the situation, if I made an error in the job I had, it could have cost me thousands. I had to quit at the top of my career. I loved what I did, and I loved the people I worked with. In no way would I keep doing anything that could affect what I did for my clients.

Thankfully, I had been mentoring a younger gal for three years and she knew how I did things. I stayed another three months to introduce her personally to families. I told them that I had chosen her from about 40 other advisors and that she would be handling my money. Since I never asked a client to do what I hadn't, my insurances were all in place. I had a disability policy, a longterm care policy, and a life insurance policy. In this disease you learn doctors and psychologists call this planning and thinking for others my ""executive functioning skills"". Imagine if I had gone into my doc and said my ""executive functioning"" is going down the tubes! We need to use the same language. Being the patient, I would call it my memory.

Inspire: How can patients better participate with their doctors in a treatment plan?

Grant: So many doctors are not used to getting the big picture. They don't have the time. Insurance dictates some of this. They don't see many rare diseases. If the MRI doesn't show a tumor, they don't take the next step. They perhaps think it is too expensive, and are afraid insurance won't cover it. Often they don't tell patients to find specialists but encourage them not to worry about it. We are working on a set of questions that are pre-clinical to take to them. This is the same reason drug companies send you questions to ask your doc. The reason I wanted so badly to finish making the film was for the financial message to get to those selling and buying long-term care insurance. Now being much more aware, I think people should buy it at age 40. I advised everyone to have an individual disability policy above and beyond their company plan if they had one. It helped a dear friend and client who had a stroke at 52.

People are bored during this part of the film and think it should shorten the film. Not a chance! Doctors must have an idea how they can ruin their patients financial lives by just saying, “Let’s see how you are in a year.” People have mostly had it for a few years anyway. So, and they get fired, too anxious to focus on work, homes get foreclosed, and families are ripped apart trying hard to deal with everything happening to them.

We choose docs on their listening skills--including the ability to draw you out and then read between the lines. Second, they must believe you. Third, and this is the hardest, as I have experienced with docs, families, and friends, they must protect the dignity of those who have no choice. Fourth, they must be up on the latest research--an easy question to find this out would be to ask them, ""What website do you read regularly?"" And fifth, they need to agree to be part of your team, not just the know-it-all.

Inspire: You have focused a lot of your advocacy educating the general public, in order to reduce the stigma of this disease. Is the medical community as a whole better informed about FTD?

Grant: I think the doctors now are responding now to FTD to how they first responded to Alzheimer’s disease years ago. It took Alzheimer’s quite a long time to get the language better in their clinical articles in how they were portraying the disease.

Inspire: How did you feel the first time you watched “Planning for Hope” when it was completed?

Grant: After getting over the shock of my voice and how much weight I gained from the tremendous amount of drugs, I felt that I accomplished my goal. We had tremendous executive producers who had no script. I just mind-mapped it at each new phase. I told the researchers not to give us sensational families. I wanted a face on FTD. Showing how young and many educated people, and siblings, are dealing with it at different stages. It shows how the timetables could be drastically different, even within a family. We attended every national FTD researcher conference since 2003. We chose the researchers with the very most passion for their contributions.

Making this film has done so much for me. I had to figure out the politics of this world. Pretty easy, and sickening. But I met some incredible researchers and some courageous families. We cried with each family as we heard their stories. In the brochures about the documentary, I say to listen to your body and get docs that listen and believe you. Otherwise, change docs!

Inspire: You have taken part in a half-dozen clinical trials, is that correct? What should people with rare diseases, who have not participated in a clinical trial, know about the process?

Grant: Yes, I have participated in numerous clinical trials across the country and on the Web. We researched the Web for all the trials. There are many clinical trials written up in journals and on the Web that the public can participate in. Search out what doctors are researching your rare disease. It is really OK to call the researchers in advance so you know how much time you have with the researchers. My passion is to keep the researchers on their toes.

Inspire: Your screen name is “Labrat” in your online support community, so you clearly embrace being part of research.

Grant: I love science. When I heard about the transgenic mice that can be given some of these rare diseases, I was fascinated with the research. The short time of the mouse’s life expectancy speeds up the research process for a cure. Thus, my “Labrat” name I use on the FTD online support group. When I first joined it several years ago, there were 500 people. Now there are over 4,200. I started a chat room for the “sufferers” where we support each other. I no longer feel so isolated. I got a lot of input for ""Planning for Hope"" from the group. I asked them for their early symptoms, what things they think are important to tell others.

The robots being used now in the drug discoveries, also speed up the new research for cures. There are new sophisticated neuro-imaging techniques; if MRIs show nothing, a PETSCAN is critical. Genetic researchers have now discovered the whole human genome. FTD can be sporadic, familial, or hereditary. Finding the genetic mutations opens the door to help future generations.

Inspire: How does it make you feel when people affected by FTD thank you for what you’re doing?

Grant: It makes me feel good that they think what I’m doing is going to help them too. I was most touched by my nephew when told me, ""Aunt Susie, I get it. I will take over being the labrat if you want.""

Inspire: We see so often in our support communities examples of people with serious diseases helping to further research, and helping to support and educate others--many of whom they will never meet or even know by name. Your own health is failing, yet you’re driven to do more in FTD research and advocacy.

Grant: I am not done yet. I like to add to the world knowledge of FTD. I have high hopes it will help my family with the same genes in the future. I love my life and hope to live every moment to the fullest. My tagline is “Live Fast, Love Lots, and Protect the Dignity of Those who have No Choice.”

I was told by two doctors that I NEED surgery, once I went to the speicialist he stated I would need 6 to 12 treatments of freezing them off.

I did the treatment about 3 times, but only to tell they were getting bigger.

Once I got my health insurance I went to visit a dermatologist and an Internal Medicine doctor, they both referred ALDARA, however I know I have internal warts.

I have yet to get ALDARA due to the high cost of it and the fact Surgery might be a better option since I do have internal warts.

JohnNovack,https://www.inspire.com/m/JohnNovack/,"Dear readers,

We at Inspire are pleased to bring you the latest in a series of interviews with people making contributions to patients and caregivers worldwide. We are posting these interviews in a Q&A format as a news feature for members of all communities on Inspire.

Terminally ill with cervical cancer, Michele Baldwin became the first woman in history to paddleboard 700 miles down the Ganga River in India. Baldwin completed the journey, the Starry Ganga expedition, in the late fall of 2011 to raise awareness of the disease and funds for its treatment through the Global Initiative Against HPV and Cervical Cancer. Her friend, filmmaker, Nat Stone, accompanied Baldwin. While making scheduling stops along the Ganga River (sometimes known as the Ganges), Baldwin met with medical leaders in India. Baldwin, a Buddhist, chose India for her trip as India has the highest amount of deaths annually from cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the second most deadly cancer among women worldwide, and is an especially serious problem in India, where it kills 74,000 women a year.

A mother of three, Baldwin, is a member of the National Cervical Cancer and HPV Coalition Support Community on Inspire. I spoke to her by phone at her New Mexico home, where she is now on hospice care.

Inspire: Because you decided to make this very public gesture, you are a symbol to many now with cervical cancer and with cancers of all types. Why do you think you have gotten this reception?

Baldwin: It means the world to me. I think I represent a part of what we as people have inside of us, and that is strength in the face of adversity. Many, many people are afraid to act on that strength for whatever reason. There’s a million and one excuses not to do the things we dream of, and many people are just unable to do those things. I wasn’t sure I could do this trip at all. I remember going for a long work in New Mexico and I could barely walk 100 yards. Yet I now hold the world’s record for paddleboarding for women. I doubled the next farthest distance so far. In the beginning in India, even on the plane over, I didn’t know any single day that I could do it. But I did.

Inspire: Was there a time during the trip when you knew you could complete it?

Baldwin: Yeah, it was about three days before Varanasi, the last city of the expedition, and I realized that I was going to do it, and I would have paddled the whole 700 miles and I really felt proud. It meant a lot to me. People don’t want to really talk about cervical cancer prevention but they will talk about an amazing deed. So, by having done this trip I can bring the conversation back to my favorite topic and ask if they’ve had a pap test this year, or have they considered Gardasil for their children. And by doing that, I save lives. What I did, in and of itself didn’t save my life, and it didn’t save anyone else’s life. But having it as a conversation starter, I’d like to think that I’m helping people live their best life by inspiring them, and I know so many women have gotten pap tests after hearing my story.

Inspire: From reading your blog and the interviews you’ve given, it’s clear that you’re funny. How has humor helped you in your illness?

Baldwin: All I can speak for is myself, and I’ve always had a sense of humor. One of my favorite my favorite jokes is, “What do you call a girl with multiple lymphomas?”

Inspire: What?

Baldwin: A lymphomanic! (laughs) I would say that on my way into surgery, and I would say it as often as I could around the hospital. I do know there have been many times when I’ve been in chemotherapy, or in surgery, and I’m telling jokes and I’m lightening the mood for everyone else, but I knew deep inside that I was really scared. And so, I check myself with that. I make sure that I’m not masking. I usually do say at some point, “I am scared,” and I think that’s important to do. The other day my son was looking at a little Mexican knickknack I had and I said, “Go ahead, take it, please,” and he said, “I can wait a month.” That little scoundrel! (laughs) So, I think when there are things people are afraid of and things people tiptoe around, then I head straight into it.

Inspire: Is there anything you’d like to add?

Baldwin: I’m very human. I don’t want anyone putting me up on any pedestal. I’m no different from anyone else in your communities who may read about me. I’ve come home now. I’m in a lot of pain. I’m in bed most of the time now, and I’m asking myself, “What am I going to do with this now, struggling with this new level of health?” I can’t paddleboard, I can’t snowboard, I can’t run, I can’t go to the gym. And so, I haven’t figured it out yet, what I’m going to do. But like I said, I’m going to go out with a bang, so I’m not going to go out laying here in bed, I don't think. I’ll figure something else out, and that’s the struggle we all have, is how to live our best with what we have.

Walter,https://www.inspire.com/m/Walter/,"Hello everyone,

I'm writing to let you know about a new Inspire feature that we launched last night, designed to help you keep track of conversations you're interested in. We call it ""following"" and here's how it works.

First, whenever you reply to a post, you'll see a checkbox under the area where you type your reply that says ""Follow replies."" It's checked by default. Keep that checkbox checked and you'll receive an e-mail notification whenever there are new replies to the post. Previously, you only heard about new replies if you were the author of the original post, or someone replied directly to you. Now you'll receive a notification of any new replies. We added this because we heard from many of you that you often have new replies in posts but don't receive notifications about them, because they weren't made directly to you. Not to mention that if you're participating in a conversation, you're probably interested to hear what everyone else has to say. Here's what that checkbox looks like:



If you're worried about getting too much e-mail, we did do some things to keep the amount of e-mail you receive from us reasonable. Specifically, we've starting combining notifications of replies to posts into fewer e-mails. Instead of sending you an e-mail for every reply, we now e-mail you only on the half hour, telling you about all new replies in that period, in a single e-mail. This cuts down on the amount of e-mail you receive from us, but gives you all of the same information.

RoxxieBlue,https://www.inspire.com/m/RoxxieBlue/,"Home from my colposcopy appointment. They found 4 'abnormal' areas and took 5 biopsies. I am in a lot of pain.

The highlights:
1.The HPV I have *is* one of the ones that cause cancer.
2. I turn 27 (ouch) in 6.5 months, so if they want to give me guardasil to treat the HPV, i have to start right away. Doctor is going to be contacting my insurance to get me approved.
3. It's the holiday season and so i wont get the pathology results until the middle of next month. Appointment on the 14th at 9:30 (bonus of being on this site is i now have a written down reminder, sweet).
4. I got a free nuvaring and i didn't have to pay a co-pay this time. Yay money.

My doc laughed at me when she asked how i was and i said 'well i dont have the HPV that causes warts, so i feel pretty awesome even though I just basically said I'd rather have cancer than warts. Man I'm shallow.'

So one milestone down, many more to go. Apparently it takes up to 2 years to clear this up.","November 21, 2011 at 8:27 pm",4 Replies,"About RoxxieBlue

hi
i am a 55 yo woman who has hpv and already had a hysterectomy 4 years ago because I had precancerous cells in my cervix. now i have precancerous cells on my vaginal walls. i am just starting and still have to see a gynicological/oncologist. I also have severe fibromyalgia, diabeties"
Coco_21,https://www.inspire.com/m/Coco_21/,"When i was 16 i was tested hpv positive, and when i had gone to the clinic i asked the doc about it and she said it would go away on its own. when i was 16 i believe is when hpv was new to the media.

i am now 21 and have recently got a papsmear again, i just got a call today and have been told im hpv postitive (still) my pap was abnormal and i need to go in for a coloscopy. i was devistated.

a few months ago i was having bleeding when i wasnt on my period so i went to the doc and they put me on birth control it has sorta improved. but now i was reasearching cervical cancer and they said ""vaginal bleeding"" is a symptom. i am seriously freaking out. i really want kids one day and am just terrified.

so my concerns is, should i have not waited? do you think from my age 16 till now it has gotten worse? is the unusual bleeding from something else possibly?

coloscopy can it tell immidiatly what is wrong? is there anyway u can turn out fine?
im really worried and have no one to talk to about this. if you have any knowledge on this please let me know and give me your feedback it would be much appreciated ! i have only had sex with one person which really sucks also the way life works.

again thank you so much.","August 25, 2011 at 6:12 pm",3 Replies,"About Coco_21

JohnNovack,https://www.inspire.com/m/JohnNovack/,"Dear readers,

We at Inspire are pleased to bring you the latest in a series of interviews with people we feel are making contributions to helping patients worldwide. We are posting these interviews in a Q&A format in my Journal as a news feature for members of all communities on Inspire.

The Inspire community now is approaching 200,000 registered members worldwide. There are some members who are noteworthy for where they’re from, what they’ve experienced, or how they interact with fellow members. Mithra Behnam Mojtahedi of Tehran, Iran, is a standout mainly because of the poetic way she writes, and the deep connections she has made with fellow members from the US, Canada, the UK, and elsewhere. “My friends here and I are now a family stretched around a circle with a diameter of more than 6,000 miles,” Mithra has observed. Inspire, you likely know, is headquartered in Princeton, NJ, and most members are from North America.

She joined Inspire as a caregiver for her parents. (Her mother died May 8, 2010, of esophageal cancer, and her father died January 25, 2011, from lung cancer.) She remains an active member of several Inspire communities, particularly the Lung Cancer Survivors Support Community, offering advice and comfort from a caregiver’s perspective. She is involved with the Iranian non-governmental organization SEPAS (which means THANKS, and stands for Salamati Pas Az Saratan, “Health after cancer”).

Her involvement, and the contributions of other members from countries far from New Jersey, help enrich the online community. One member wrote to her recently, “Your words soothe and encourage like a loving hug.” Another, from the US Midwest, said, “Here we are speaking comfortably with people hours away from us. I like this. And the most wonderful part is that we are more similar than we are different.”

I interviewed Mithra recently via email. Our online conversation follows:

Inspire: What do you recall about first posting to an online community here?

Mithra: My first post received 10 replies, from kind welcomes to serious questions and information. This was really heartwarming and encouraging. I thought that I have landed in the best territory, where sharing and inspiring were the codes! This touched my heart.

Inspire: Did you have concerns about joining a US-based online community, in that you don't share much by way of background with most of the members of the communities?

Mithra: No, not at all. I was well acquainted with the social media and knew the mechanisms well. The main cause for which we registered ourselves on the Inspire acts as that shared background. Here, everyone becomes a comrade, a friend or family, because we are facing the same challenge—more or less depending on the issues one faces as a patient or caretaker, etc. The magic of the social media impact is so strong in these cases. Amazing is how our challenges, feelings and experiences are the same regardless of the geographical and political boundaries that separate us. That Inspire is a US-based community was not a problem for me. I have previously been in touch with Americans in professional and personal capacities, while I worked for the Washington Post as its researcher-stringer in Iran. Despite the rough verbal exchanges in the past three decades between the two governments, this also shows that humane ties know no boundaries. Inspire is a lively community. And I am very glad to be a member to it.

Inspire: Do you have other examples of making healthcare connections online?

Mithra: I used to write a blog after my Mama passed away and through that I got to know an American lady who had to deal with the terrible challenges of losing her little daughter, her sister and her mother. We started writing to each other after I registered on a Website for handling grief and hope. By way of writing this blog I was able to take steps on my journey from grief to joy. Interestingly, I have not been able to write much there since I started writing on the Inspire. One reason could be that here I am communicating with real people; while in the blog you are writing something for the virtual space. As the audience of the blog shape and leave comments, writing becomes more targeted and takes the form of a dialogue in some cases.

Inspire: Does it surprise you to read members referring to you as a ""sister,"" and the way that they mourned the loss of your father earlier this year?

Mithra: I was very touched--very much so. I am a woman of strong communication skills and broad social links in my own community and country. This is partly due to my personal characteristics (thanks to Mama and Baba) and partly due to the kind of jobs I have had: teaching, journalism, arts, working with the civil society, et al. I am able to make close ties to people and communicate with them well. People get friendly with me in short time, and refer to me as their ‘close’ friend and use sentences like ‘you are like my sister, therefore I tell you this’. There is a feeling of trust that my straightforward and sincere behavior builds up in them, I hear. But I cannot deny that I was surprised how they mourned with me—in a kind and sisterly way indeed—without even having seen him. I was so moved by their replies to my updates and even after the passing of my father, when I kind of disappeared for short time; they enquired where I was and how we were coping with the grief and pain. It was really touching and surprising, in terms of how human feelings can link people, cultures and souls across the miles.

Inspire: Do you find it surprising sometimes that you have considerable support and love from a group of Western, mostly American, people who probably don't know many Iranian people?

Mithra: I suspect in some cases you don't know the real names of some of these people who now call you friend. Like I said, I AM touched greatly but not surprised. Many of the gaps are created as a result of not sharing information and knowledge. For most of the past three decades, Iran has been an unknown topic for many people in the Western world. This is both because of the stereotypes that the statesmen of these countries impose upon the media in different ways, closure of Iran toward the global public contemplation and lack of direct tourism exchanges or cultural ties between the two countries. Many of my journalist friends who traveled to Iran for the first time were shocked to see us working with them freely; perhaps they were confined within the images distributed by the 1980s' movie ""Not without My Daughter."" What we do here is to bridge these gaps which have been created and deepened by the politicians and lack of information. Lack of information creates these gaps, but we are able to fill these gaps with real pictures with sharing information using the right means.","July 19, 2011 at 4:50 pm",14 Replies,"About JohnNovack

JohnNovack,https://www.inspire.com/m/JohnNovack/,"Dear Inspire Community Members,

We at Inspire are pleased to bring you the latest in a series of Q&A interviews with people we feel are making contributions to helping patients worldwide. We are posting these interviews in a Q&A format in my Journal as a news feature for Inspire community members.

I spoke recently to Dave deBronkart, a kidney cancer survivor and patient advocate who is known widely as “e-Patient Dave.” deBronkart was diagnosed in January 2007 with Stage IV, Grade 4 renal cell carcinoma at a very late stage--his median survival time at diagnosis, in fact, was just 24 weeks. An active participant in his treatment plan, deBronkart used the Internet every way possible to partner with his care team; today he is well.

He described his cancer journey in a book, Laugh, Sing and Eat Like a Pig.

Inspire: You recently gave an interview in which you said you wanted to change the dynamic of measuring patients’ “compliance” or “adherence” to therapy prescribed by doctors, and instead to consider therapy as a shared goal, with the operative term being “achievement.” Can you expand on that point?

deBronkart: As I’ve looked as healthcare for the last couple of years, and after my own illness, it occurred to me that there is an essential flaw at the foundation of how we all think about healthcare. We think about it as something that is done to the patient, or directions given to the patient, and the patient is the unknowing and obedient—or disobedient—recipient of instructions. In reality, I like the perspective of the patient being like the player on the court, and the physician is the coach. If I have a running coach or basketball coach or swimming coach and I don’t do what the coach says, I’m going to have no achievement.

Inspire: In cases like managing a chronic illness, or rehabbing from an injury?

deBronkart: Or exercising, weight control, taking your medications, whatever. Phrasing it in terms like compliance and adherence just is guilt-inducing and doesn’t get anywhere. I myself am far more inspired by the idea of achievement than I am by the idea of not being so disobedient. At the core of what we’re calling participatory medicine is the idea that it’s not like the conventional view that a patient in treatment is like a car in a car wash. It goes through and gets things done to it. I don’t have a nice offsetting metaphor for that, but when you’re participating, it’s a partnership. You just don’t sit there and wait to have things done to you.

Inspire: From a personal perspective, connecting with others on the ACOR online community helped you during your illness and recovery, true?

deBronkart: Absolutely.

Inspire: How specifically did that component of reaching out and finding others online help you?

deBronkart: A common benefit of online communities that did not happen to me is finding out about treatment options. In my case, I was already at the best place in the world for my disease, and they were already planning to give me the treatment that the ACOR members recommended. However, what my doctors couldn’t give me was information on how to deal with the treatment, which is very difficult. My particular treatment has side effects up the wazoo, and yet, like all side effects, they vary from person to person, so I wanted to know what to expect. There is no Web site, FDA-approved or anything, that will tell you that. But the people who have been down that road all know what they encountered, and they shared that with me.

Inspire: And the impact of that sharing?

deBronkart: To some physicians, if a side effect doesn’t influence how your cells turn out, it’s irrelevant. Here is where patients shift from not just participating in their care but defining what care should be. Because I want a treatment that is not just going to fix my cells but not make my life miserable. And better yet, if the treatment is going to make my life miserable, I want practical advice on how to deal with it.

Medicine as a profession has partial answers to this. When my leg was in the process of breaking, it was really painful to walk on, so they had crutches or a walker as a way of dealing with it. But when they run out of things like that, that’s where other patients can give you practical advice. And they did.

Now, the interesting question here: What difference did this make? People have said to me, “Dave, your mental attitude was fabulous. That must be what saved your life.” I asked my oncologist, Dr. David McDermott, how much my attitude had to do with my recovery, and he said, “I have no doubt that the interleukin is what killed your tumors. But I don’t know if you could have tolerated enough to do the job if you hadn’t been so proactive about educating yourself about the treatment, so you were prepared to see it through to the other end.”

Inspire: And you were aided with information and support through the online resources you sought.

deBronkart: Yes, and it goes without saying that there’s immense value to discovering that you’re not alone. Immense value.

Inspire: Did that surprise you?

deBronkart: Not really, because I’ve always been a social networking kind of guy. I sometimes say that I learned to be an empowered patient back on the desktop publishing forum on CompuServe in 1989. There I was, struggling with early versions of Quark Xpress, like why doesn’t this feature work, and I’m doing what the instruction manual says, and then I get into this community where people who are struggling with the same issues can help you. The most natural thing in the world for me when I was diagnosed was in addition to going to the best doctors I could find, to get the best community peer group.

Inspire: You’re known as someone with exudes a lot of positive energy. What in your role as a patient advocate frustrates you?

deBronkart: I consider myself part of a movement. We are a movement for social change. It’s not identical to women’s suffrage, the Civil Rights movement, gay rights, feminism, but it’s parallel in some important ways: there is a class of people who could, if the social structure allowed it, have access to a far better life than they currently do, and there are social structures in place that are keeping that from changing. As the change starts to happen, through people awakening and realizing they can speak up and ask for things, some people will ask for things, and some people will start demanding things.

I don’t know if we’ll ever get to the point of people burning buildings down as part of the e-patient movement, but we will increasingly have people say, “Damn it, you guys killed my baby, and that is not OK to be quiet about. Patient safety is important,” or, “Damn it, why didn’t you tell me about interleukin? Why did you put me on some other treatment that will keep me from getting sicker, but will give me no chance at ever getting better?”

What I see now, I wouldn’t say it gets me down, but if you’re in the process of climbing a mountain, and you wake up one morning and the fog has cleared and you see that you have farther to climb than you realized, what I see very clearly now is that we don’t yet have an ecosystem—a network of interacting players—of opportunities for people to get engaged in this game of changing healthcare.

Inspire: How so?

deBronkart: If somebody wants to be a patient activist speaker at conferences, we don’t yet have a patient speakers bureau, where a conference organizer can go and say, “Get me a speaker who talks about diabetes, or what have you,” and so there’s no place for the would-be speaker to go to register.

And we don’t yet have policies in Washington that allow grassroots citizens to get paid for their time participating. I did a speech proposal called, Why America Needs a Patient-in-Chief,” and one of my points was that patients are the only people in the whole health ecosystem who have to take a day off from work to participate in policy meetings in Washington, because federal regulations say you can’t pay citizens for their testimony in policy meetings. So what do you get? You get professional lobbyists. You get industry employees. Some people say there’s malice in those meetings, with people trying to tilt the system in their own direction—but even if there weren’t, you just obviously never get an outcome that represents the person who is not there.

Inspire: Because they’re not represented.

deBronkart: And it does no good to say, “We were thinking about you when we designed this. We hope you like it.” My own hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess, had complaints about their ICUs some years ago, and they had a big long project to make them more patient-centered, and the moment they showed the newly designed ICU to patients and families, they said it was totally wrong, so the hospital started over with a clean piece of paper and involved patients and families from the beginning.

Inspire: Anything you’d like to add?

deBronkart: A lot of people today are talking about patient-centered care. Well, I say, it can’t be patient-centered if patients aren’t smack in the middle of saying what it is–and saying how it’s going, before, during and after treatment.

JohnNovack,https://www.inspire.com/m/JohnNovack/,"Dear Inspire Community Members,

We at Inspire are pleased to bring you the latest in a series of Q&A interviews with people we feel are making contributions to helping patients worldwide. We are posting these interviews in a Q&A format in my Journal as a news feature for members of all communities on Inspire.

I recently interviewed Kevin Pho, known widely as the blogger KevinMD. Pho is a member of USA Today’s Board of Contributors. He writes and speaks on topics related to healthcare social media, and his opinion pieces appear in publications such as USA Today, CNN.com, and the New York Times. Pho received his medical degree and completed residency at Boston University School of Medicine. He is board certified in internal medicine and practices primary care in Nashua, NH.

Inspire: Do you think it’s the norm now for patients bringing printouts of health news or information from the Internet to their physicians and expect to talk about those printouts?

Pho: I can say that in general patients are using the Web more to empower themselves. Information now flows two ways. Before, healthcare used to be a more hierarchical, one-way transfer of information, but now, with the power of the Web, more patients are going online and empowering themselves to become better-educated patients.

Inspire: From your perspective, what is the impact of that shift?

Pho: I’ll be honest. Not everyone in the medical profession is happy with that. But whenever I cross the country and tell doctors about this phenomenon, I let them know it’s happening anyway, and we might as well embrace it. The longer it takes for us to embrace it, the bigger the disconnect that we’re going to have with patients, and that’s going to make our jobs harder in the exam room in the end.

Inspire: When you have conversations with fellow physicians who have legitimate criticisms of patients becoming more active in their own treatment, particularly by researching online, how do those conversations usually go?

Pho: I always say, “If patients aren’t going to come to you looking to help interpret health information, they’re going to look elsewhere. They’re going to look further on the Web.” There was a study earlier this year that only 25% of patients going on the Web looking for health information actually checked the source of that information. So I think, as medical professionals it’s our responsibility to interpret what patients find on the Web, make sure it is medically sound, and help them translate it and help patients apply that information to themselves.

Inspire: To be so active and entrenched in healthcare social media probably makes you think sometimes that it is very widespread, but studies show that it’s not widespread yet.

Pho: If you look at social media as it relates to healthcare, just last year the American Medical Association came up with professional guidelines, and hospitals are just now embracing social media and recognizing it as a viable forum to communicate real-time information to patients. And I think in the medical profession we’re still a step behind, so one of my goals when I travel across the country is to convince doctors of the value of social media and to let them know it’s here to stay. So, if I were to use one word, it would be that healthcare social media is in its infancy still.

Inspire: How would you define the term “empowered patient?”

Pho: I would say it would be a patient who is an active participant in their healthcare, and wants to play an active role in the shared decision about their health. I think there are some doctors who fear empowered patients and think that it’s infringing on the traditional doctor-patient relationship. But I think the trend is toward more shared decision-making and having patients being partners in their healthcare. And I think it’s to a physician’s benefit that they recognize that phenomenon.

Inspire: What qualities do effective “e-patients” share?

Pho: I think they’re proactive in their healthcare. They’re inquisitive. They like to ask questions. And they don’t always take what doctors say as the final word. As physicians, we don’t know all the answers. There are a lot of studies that get contradicted. There’s a lot of new information that comes out, and I’ll be honest, there are a lot of things doctors don’t know. So, I think it’s certainly our responsibility to keep up with that information, but patients have a responsibility too to take control of their healthcare and be that partner that really is the epitome of an ideal doctor-patient relationship.

Inspire: You touched there on the responsibility of patients. There’s often discussions about the levels of responsibility that patients should assume in this new paradigm, and the classic tale about patients who don’t follow the agreed-upon treatment protocol, such as diet and exercise, and who then blames the physician for poor health outcomes. How might social media help in improving that hoped-for shared outcome?

Pho: I think it breaks down barriers between doctors and patients. Social media introduces that transparency that was lacking before. Now, whenever I write in my blog, behind the proverbial curtain, patients have a better idea of some of the things physicians are facing. They can understand why we sometimes run an hour late, why we can only spend five to 10 minutes with patients, why we do some of the more unpleasant things that we do. And I think, on the other hand, through social media, doctors can hear from patients as well. Whether it’s comments on my blog, and sometimes I invite patients to write a guest post because I think it’s important for doctors to hear the stories from patients too. A lot of doctors haven’t gone through personally what their patients are going through, so I think it’s important for each party to share that experience, whether it’s a blog, or on Twitter, or Facebook, or on groups like Inspire, I think it’s important that each party hears each other’s perspectives.

Inspire: People are using Yelp and Angie’s List and online customer rating services like those more regularly. Do you see patient-driven online physician rating and hospital rating services becoming more popular?

Pho: Let me take a step back on this, and talk about online physician rating sites in general. I wrote about this topic recently. I get a lot of stories from doctors saying patients wrote negatives reviews about them online, and they want to know what they can do about it. The first thing I tell them is it’s here to stay. Patients want a way, like TripAdvisor, like Yelp, they want a way to know from other people what it’s like to go to a certain doctor or hospital. And, the most convenient user-friendly way to do today are online rating sites. I do think there are some problems with those things.

Inspire: Such as?

Pho: First, a lot of them are anonymous. Some of them don’t allow doctors and hospitals to respond, and frankly, also, not enough patients use them, so a lot of those reviews are skewed. I think the sites can tremendous useful for doctors to receive that kind of feedback and frankly, there are some doctors who need to hear that type of feedback. So, what I tell doctors is that they need to encourage more of their patients to rate them online. There was an article I always cite, that was in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, that showed close to 90% of patient ratings of doctors online are actually positive. So, if you get more and more patients rating doctors online, chances are they’re going to be better what doctors think, because it’s going to present a more accurate picture of what a doctor is like, and some of those outlier negative ratings will just be considered as such.

Inspire: Let me return to the topic of the patient-physician relationship with regard to patient empowerment. When a patient begins an appointment with you saying that she read something online about her health, where does the conversation usually go from there?

Pho: Every conversation is unique, but I always try to let the patient lead and let the patient take charge as to where he or she wants to go with that information. I always ask them what they read online and what they think about it, and if there are any medical inaccuracies I’d certainly give my take on it. And I never discourage patients from researching online. I realize that telling patients to not go online for health information is not a viable option. I’ll give patients tips as to what are reputable sites, to be careful as to what someone is saying on blogs, as they may not be as accurate as a hospital-based or government-based Web site. Certainly everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so if a patient draws a different opinion than I do from an article, I will certainly give my take, but in the end it’s the patient’s ultimate choice as to where they want to take their medical care. I’m here as a guide, and I’m here as a resource.

Inspire: It can’t be easy, particularly in the US system that you work in, to devote enough time to have substantive discussions with patients who bring some amount of online research to appointments.

Pho: It does take time, and the way that doctors are financially incentivized, and the way that our medical system is built is based on 10- to 15-minute office visits, and really is not meant for long conversations. And that’s a shame, and I hope that will change in the next five to 10 years. What I always tell patients is to prioritize their questions and concerns. I think that patients understand that there are cases where I’m not going to be able to address all of their concerns in a single office visit, and there are some issues that deserve their own office visit. Rather than give a rushed version, it’s better to have patients come back and give the issue the time it deserves.

We wanted to make you aware of an announcement today by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that we think you’ll find interesting.

We are the team behind this site. We feel very fortunate to be able to work on a project that can make a real difference in helping people to live their lives happily.

Inspire was created in 2005 by a group of friends. We were each dealing with important medical issues in our families, and we found that while the Internet was a useful source for authoritative medical information, it was not a safe, welcoming place for us to find support.

We created Inspire to change all that. We envisioned a place where we as patients, caregivers, family and friends could support one another, and where we could do so in a safe, secure, privacy-protected environment.

We are dedicated to building the best online health communities possible. Like our community members, all of us have faced health challenges of our own - and we know from personal experience how valuable the support and encouragement of others can be.

Our tagline, 'Together We're Better', is at the heart of what we do."

JohnNovack,https://www.inspire.com/m/JohnNovack/,"Dear Inspire Community Members,

We at Inspire are pleased to bring you the latest in a series of Q&A interviews with people we feel are making contributions to helping patients worldwide. We are posting these interviews in a Q&A format in my Journal as a news feature for Inspire community members.

I recently interviewed cancer survivor Bonnie Diraimondo, a patient advocate, author, and speaker on the topic of HPV (Human Papillomavirus) and cervical cancer. She is the author of the book, Any Mother’s Daughter, which details her struggle with HPV. Organizers of the International Papillomavirus Conference have invited Diraimondo to speak at the opening ceremonies. The conference will take place this fall in Berlin, Germany.

Diraimondo is a member of the online support community of the National Cervical Cancer Coalition (NCCC).

Inspire: When were you first diagnosed with HPV?

Diraimondo: I've been a registered nurse since 1983 and I spent the majority of my life living in New Jersey until relocating to Florida in 2002. I was initially diagnosed with HPV in 1987, which, at that time, involved vulvar dysplasia. It has since gone on to involve the cervix, vagina, and anus with two invasive anal cancers both of which I have survived--so far.

Inspire: What made you want to write and speak on this topic?

Diraimondo: I wrote my book because after two decades I found that there was still too little accurate information available regarding HPV. It is quite an honor to have your work endorsed by and foreword written by the Nobel Prize winner who won for actually discovering that HPV caused cervical cancer. I started my website and blog two years ago to provide medically accurate info and the site is registered by HonCode, an organization which certifies online medical info accuracy.

Inspire: Tell us more about the conference this fall in Berlin.

Diraimondo: The International Papillomavirus Conference has been held each year for the past 26 years. At no time has a patient ever been requested to participate in the conference, let alone to speak and at the Opening Ceremonies no less. This is truly an honor as the Opening Ceremonies draw 1,400 of the world’s most prominent researchers, clinicians and other experts in the field of HPV. At this point, I am considered an expert in the field as well--otherwise I wouldn't even be qualified to speak to such a group. It is very promising that such a group desires the patient's perspective as they move forward in their research and clinically addressing HPV in the patient setting.

Inspire: What key message do you want to deliver to those attendees?

Diraimondo: The medical community in general, perhaps not these 1,400 individuals attending this conference, does not place enough emphasis on educating themselves and their patients about HPV, and medical professionals can literally be jeopardizing the lives of their patients by providing inaccurate information. It’s one thing to provide no information but it’s another thing to provide inaccurate information.

Inspire: Do you think you’ll feel a weight of responsibility for speaking for patients like you?

Diraimondo: I do feel a significant burden of responsibility. The onus is on my shoulders to speak for the patient community. I want to convey to them, that as a result of their status within the HPV community, they are able to bring about the swiftest changes when it comes to both work on a therapeutic vaccine as well as the education of practicing physicians, which is desperately needed. Far too many physicians fail to recognize the potentially lethal complications of this virus.

Inspire: How would you define an empowered patient?

Diraimondo: I’d say it’s someone who actively seeks to educate themselves regarding their condition to as close a level of their physician as possible, who has found their own voice and can advocate for themselves and who is not afraid to disagree with nor confront a physician when it comes to their care and treatment both physical and emotional.

Inspire: You are a medical professional, and are unsparing of criticizing the medical establishment for how it treats patients. There are, however, some doctors whom you recognized in the “Acknowledgments” portion of your book.

Diraimondo: Despite the number of grossly incompetent physicians whom I had the unfortunate experience of dealing with along my cancer journey, there were still that handful whose true compassion, empathy and willingness to do their utmost for me, regardless of financial circumstances, as a patient truly exemplified what a physician should be. It is those doctors whom I acknowledged in my book.

Inspire: The Inspire community as a whole is made up of about 180,000 members, who are involved in support groups of all types. What advice do you have for people who feel overwhelmed in the healthcare system, regardless where they live, and regardless of their condition?

Diraimondo: At times, it feels as though the individuals who are part of a system developed to aid you with your health issues are there to simply give you a difficult time and make you jump through as many hoops as possible. This can quickly wear one down and often, this is exactly what they want.

So for those feelings overwhelmed and perhaps abused within the healthcare system I would first acknowledge to them that they are not the first and unfortunately without significant reforms, will not be the last--but when you cannot get in through the front door you sometimes need to choose the back door. What I mean by this is that whether it be within a doctor’s office or a hospital medical center, there are always others operating behind the scenes who may assist you in getting what you need so don’t be afraid to utilize them. Try to stay within the chain of command when possible although sometimes it may be necessary to just go straight to the top depending upon your situation and results you have received thus far. It can be very frustrating and does take persistence. You do get more flies with honey, as they say, and logic can be a very effective tool. Regardless of how you handle it be sure to document everything including the name of who you spoke to, their title and department, dates, content of the conversation and results achieved. No one can be held accountable if you cannot remember their names.

Inspire: Patients often feel they can’t navigate the system, even if they have the documentation, the wherewithal, and even have the contacts.

Diraimondo: There are times when you will have to fight, via complaint letters to medical associations, for example, to get what you need. You must remember that all medical organizations have billing departments and someone who is ultimately responsible to assist patients when it comes to finances. These are the individuals who can negotiate bills, adjust off balances on an account, agree to accept your insurance as payment in full, despite them telling you that insurance prohibits this that is untrue.

Even managed care companies recognize the necessity on occasion for a medical establishment to alter their standard policies to benefit patients in financial need. So long as this is not done to an abusive level, it is indeed acceptable. Non-profit hospitals are required in order to maintain their tax-exempt status to provide a certain amount of charity care to patients. You may need to get past your own ego and accept help when it is available in order to defray costs elsewhere.

The Internet can provide a plethora of useful information however you must be sure the site you are utilizing is either a federal or state site, research documented in reputable journals, or the site is certified by HONCode for medically accurate information.

Inspire: Any final advice for patients are caregivers?

Diraimondo: Above all, do not put anyone above yourself in terms of importance. Don’t put the doctor on a pedestal. Kick him off. Put him on the same level you are, to the extent that you can. Get copies of your medical records. There’s nothing that says you can’t educate yourself about your disease. Every life has value and that value is not based upon one’s title or status in an organization. Advocate for your life as if it were the most important thing in the world, because it is. Refuse to be demeaned or degraded and call anyone and everyone that may do so on the carpet.

JohnNovack,https://www.inspire.com/m/JohnNovack/,"Dear Inspire Community Members,

We at Inspire are pleased to bring you the second in a series of Q&A interviews with people who are making contributions to help patients worldwide. We are posting these interviews in a Q&A format in my Journal as a news feature for Inspire community members.

I spoke recently to Kelly Young, a patient advocate who blogs at Rheumatoid Arthritis Warrior. Young has battled chronic autoimmune illness most of her life, and was diagnosed with RA in 2006. Young, on her site, has written in detail about the onset of RA. (Click here to read that story.)

Young was the first patient and blogger to attend the American College of Rheumatology Scientific Meeting as a member of the press. In addition to her daily blogs on Rheumatoid Arthritis Warrior, Young writes periodically for other websites, including Orthopedic Posterous, WEGO Health, and Health Care Professionals Live. She is the mother of five, a home-schooler, Bible teacher, NASA enthusiast, and NFL fan.

Inspire: What made you want to start a blog and your other advocacy and information efforts you do through social media?

Young: When you look at the tagline for the blog, it’s, “Bringing encouragement and information to fight RA.” For the encouragement part, I’ll say that when I got this diagnosis, it pulled the rug out from under me and changed my whole life, and I didn’t know anyone else with this diagnosis. In the next couple of years I met a few people with the same diagnosis and I realized how valuable it was to know someone going through the same challenges. I started finding connections anywhere I could. I decided to have a mission of helping people find a friend with RA, so that’s where the social media part comes in. And the encouragement comes from just knowing someone else, who can say, “I hear you,” and they understand what you’re experiencing because they’ve walked that road.

Inspire: And the information component of your blog?

Young: The information part is actually just as big a component. I myself was looking for information when I was diagnosed, and pretty much all of the patients that I’ve met are looking for information. Trying to find information about RA that is accurate is hard. I would go from place to place and not see my experience reflected in the information, and that was very aggravating. So, I became determined to make accurate information more accessible for RA patients. I’m still working on it, and I feel like I’ve barely made a dent. But there’s a lot of information my site—I’ve made about 450 pages. It’s information from the patient’s viewpoint, with humor and in a matter-of-fact tone of voice. I’m not claiming to be anything I’m not. I don’t have a medical degree. I’m trying to be a reporter for the patient.

Inspire: You wrote a blog post called 20 Rheumatoid Arthritis Patient Facts I learned from RA Patients and they were short, pithy opinions, like, “There are a disproportionate number of nurses and hairdressers with RA,” and, “Many of us have had a doctor doubt our veracity.” What made you write that one?

Young: I was really tired, and I just stood back and made a list of what I’ve noticed, and I’ve found so many times that that is where my readers are too. It never fails that those lists are very popular. I try to be cautious and not be identifying posts as scientific studies, but I get an enormous amount of data from feedback on the comments section on the blog, and private email messages and responses on Facebook. So when I say, “It doesn’t seem like the swelling correlates with the pain,” I could write a book to back that up.

Inspire: Your comment speaks to the tremendous resource of patient first-hand comments and observations.

Young: This is a disease that is very misunderstood by the medical community. When I talk with really good doctors and really smart scientists, that’s what they say—they know that. But out there in the field, the medical community acts like they do understand RA, and we patients don’t, and we’re wrong. So, there is a major disconnect between what is written and told about this disease, and what people live with it say about it.

Inspire: What blog posting in recent times got a particularly large response from readers and why do you think it got the reaction it did?

Young: It probably was the post I called, Having a Cuppa Together: a Rheumatoid Arthritis Meme. It was the very first time we’ve done a meme. I just said that I was going to answer these little questions (sample questions include, “Who helps you open doors or jars when you need it?” and “What do you wish people knew about Rheumatoid Arthritis?”), and readers can answer the questions too, and we had more than 200 replies on site, plus more that were posted as a note on Facebook or on other bloggers’ sites, so we ended up with hundreds of them, and that was kind of a surprise. And any time I take a symptom, whether it’s stiffness, or swelling, or any kind of RA symptom that there’s misunderstanding about, then there’s a huge response to it too.

I think the public service announcement posts I’ve done about RA awareness, the memes about awareness, are all saying, “This is what we have and this is what we’re experiencing, and we wish that society and the medical community understood.”

(Learn more about Young by following her on Twitter or YouTube or connecting with her on LinkedIn. She created and moderates the weekly Twitter chat on rheumatology topics, which can be followed with the hashtag #rheum. Please email me at john@inspire.com if you have suggestions for future Inspire Q&As. Feel free to post comments to this interview, and thanks for reading.)","January 21, 2011 at 8:11 pm",7 Replies,"About JohnNovack

Hope this finds you well. I'm writing to let you know about a new feature in Inspire -- an option to change the background color of our pages from white to another color of your choosing. We added this feature because a number of you let us know that you find the pages in Inspire too bright. This was especially so for those of you with uveitis and other conditions that cause light sensitivity.

Here's how the feature works:

First, visit your general settings and change the setting for ""Background color"" to ""My computer's default.""

Next, you'll need to adjust your computer to use a different color for window backgrounds. How you do this varies depending on your operating system. We've provided instructions in our FAQ for Windows 7. If you're on a different version of Windows or a different operating system, the process should be similar.

We hope this feature helps those of you who find the white background too bright. If you have questions or comments about this feature, please feel free to leave them here.

Hi Inspire members,

Periodically we at Inspire plan to interview people we feel are making contributions to helping patients worldwide, and post those interviews in a Q&A format in my Journal, as a news feature for Inspire community members. Some of the interviews will be with people who are widely known in the healthcare community, and others are relatively unknown. The only criteria are that they have to be working to help patients. Plus, they have to be interesting. (And if you have suggestions about future subjects for the Inspire Q&A, email me at john@inspire.com.)

To kick off this feature I spoke with patient advocate and author Trisha Torrey (www.everypatientsadvocate.com), a nationally recognized writer, speaker and workshop teacher on issues related to patient advocacy. A former marketing executive, Torrey became a patient advocate after enduring a misdiagnosis of cancer in 2004. She is author of the book, You Bet Your Life! The 10 Mistakes Every Patient Makes (How to Fix Them to Get the Healthcare You Deserve).

Inspire: Amid all increasing references to “epatients,” you use a term, “em-patient,” for “empowered patients.” Why “em-patient?”

Torrey: I spent 20-plus years as a marketer, long before I thought I’d have anything to do healthcare, and the only reason I have anything to do with healthcare is that I had my own run-in with the system. As a marketer, you always want words to have the same meaning to everybody. But the word “epatient” could be interpreted differently, because of the “e” in front of “patient.” Email, e-commerce, it has to do with being on the Internet, right? Being online and learning things online is a subset of everything that it means to being an empowered patient.

Inspire: Being able to go online for resources and support is key, though, correct?

Torrey: Well, the reason I use the term “em-patient” is because I’d like to see something that encompasses the entire experience, which includes how you communicate with your providers, to ensuring that you’re safe in the healthcare, to how to look things up online and make sure it’s credible information. Patients who aren’t online don’t have to feel left out.

Inspire: We see a challenging paradox in which patients want to feel empowered, want to be on more an equal footing with their caregivers, but it’s tough to rise to that challenge when you’re ill, regardless of your education, your support structure, etc., true?

Torrey: When you’re really sick, when you’ve just been diagnosed, when you’re really afraid, you likely don’t have the wherewithal to be an empowered patient. My example is, say that I just got diagnosed with cancer. I’m upset, I’m afraid, I have a million questions, but at the moment I can’t cope with my own emotions, let alone handle additional information. So I come home and stew with the emotion for a period of time. Now, for some people in that situation, that’s going to take a few hours, for others, it’s going to be a few months. Until they get past that emotion, they’re not going to be able to do anything to empower themselves around that one particular diagnosis.

Inspire: It’s not an all or nothing situation though, correct? “You’re an empowered patient or you’re not,” is not what you’re saying.

Torrey: Not at all. That’s not to say they haven’t been empowered before. A long-term diabetes patient, for example, who has taken control of their diabetes, if that patient gets a cancer diagnosis, for the moment, she’s not empowered about anything having to do with the cancer. So, until they’re ready to deal, they’re going to look to some other way, like a family member helping out, or they have to just depend on their doctor, or they have to hire an advocate. But I suppose that is what empowered really means—and that is where you are in any given moment, knowing there are tools out there to help you. You just have to choose the right ones at the right time.

Inspire: In the Inspire community there is some sharing of clinical information and some guidance on selecting clinicians, but there are very many discussion strings that are underpinned chiefly by statements of empathy and understanding that a fellow community member is hurting. And those statements, seemingly simple, are extremely powerful. Does that surprise you?

Torrey: “We hear you, and we care, and we will fill in the gap when you need us,” those are powerful magnets. I think there are a couple of aspects to all of this. First of all, one of the big things you’re talking about is the difference in the way women and men communicate. There are studies that have been done on this, but the basics are that women, when they reach out to someone, what they’re looking for is those comforting noises. And those comforting noises say, “You’re not alone, you’re not the first person who has had to deal with this, and therefore there might be some answers for you, and number three, we’re here for you when you need us.”

Inspire: And men?

Torrey: On the other hand, men, in that kind of outreach, are looking for someone to provide them with solutions. When you’re dealing with emotions like fear, sadness, or frustration, those are like holes that need to be filled. You’ve heard about this in breakups in relationships, and all of a sudden there’s a hole in your emotions that needs to be filled, and that’s why people get married a second time too fast, or they get into things that they shouldn’t be involved in, because rather than dealing with the emotion, they’re looking to fill the void. I think that’s a lot of what communities do. They rush in to fill those holes, those voids. If I’ve been diagnosed with a disease, and my body has basically betrayed me, and I need something to fill that void, if it’s 14 people in an online community saying, “We are so sorry and we’re here for you,” that helps me fill the hole—even if it’s temporary. It helps me to know I’m not in it alone.

I don’t know if this would have been as effective 20 years ago, when we were still operating under the paternalistic and benevolent “Marcus Welby, MD” model.

Inspire: How so?

Torrey: Then, we didn’t need as much other support from outside sources. The doctors then made you feel like you were being supported. There was a greater sense that your doctor was more empathetic. Now, too often, it’s this cold scientific approach, like, “Well, we ran the test and I’m sorry to tell you you’ve been diagnosed with ‘x’ disease, and what that means is you’ll have to come back here and we’ll start treatments,” and so forth. It’s an entirely different conversation than years ago. Nobody’s helping deal with the emotions yet. And patients have to do that first.

Inspire: Back to the topic of patients researching their medical conditions, or caregivers doing so for their loved ones. How can patients be more effective in communicating research they’ve found with their physicians?

Torrey: Fair or not, physicians’ time is constrained, so the first thing you want to do is to acknowledge to your doctor that his or her time is constrained. Saying this takes the docs off of the “time defensive,” where, if they see you carrying a raft of clinical papers printed off the Internet, they’re thinking, “Oh my God, I only have four minutes with this patient and I’ll never be able to have this conversation with this patient and get on to my next patient.” So, an acknowledgment of the short time is a good way to start.

Inspire: Let’s say you get good feedback from that opening discussion. And then?

Torrey: I tell patients to not show up with printouts from the computer. Do not. Be well enough versed in what the printouts say that you can carry on the conversation. Walking in the door with the raft of papers from the Internet is the visual clue to the doctor that there’s going to be a problem with your meeting. From the doctor’s point of view, he or she has had years of medical school and training. If you show up with information from the Internet and just present it like that – that comes across as if you are saying that your hour on the Internet is equivalent to their years of medical school and their experience. Now, your investment in your disease or condition certainly is as big, if not bigger, but your experience with it is not.

Inspire: Perhaps there is information you got off the Internet that’s valuable, though, and it’s tough to memorize it and be able to discuss it with your doctor.

Torrey: But the minute you show up with a bunch of printouts, most doctors will go on the defensive, and that’s not where you want to start a conversation. A way to approach this issue is to say, “What do you know about ‘x’ topic?” and let the doctor respond. If the doctor says that he or she had never heard of that topic before, then you can say, “I found information about it and I’m trying to gather more information because it’s something I’m interested in.” If the doctor discounts the topic as it relates to your medical situation, for whatever reason the doctor does that, then listen to your doctor. It’s not that you wouldn’t do more research on it, it gives you a better sense of where you stand with your doctor on that particular topic. If you just begin that conversation in that way, it’s an acknowledgment that the doctor has that much more experience with something than you do, but you still have information to discuss with your doctor.

Even though and I am only 20 years old, I have a lot I want to do before I turn 25. For instance, I would love to already be married with 2 healthy babies and be settled into a home. I feel that I am on the right track because I am close to being engaged with my boyfriend and we have been preparring to have our first baby together! However, today I discovered a possible setback to my plans of motherhood. I found out that I could possibly have pelvic inflamatory disease. After doing research, I learned that PID can cause infertility. With that settling into my brain, I have been a complete and total wreck. Now I feel that I have no future if I cannot bear child. My whole life I have been excited about finding the right person to have a family with and now that I have finally found that person, I am afraid that I will not be able to have the family that I have always wanted. I have been and will continue to pray to God to grant me the strength that I need to get through this, and hopefully I will be able to get pregnant within the next few months. I am competely terrified that I will be unable to have a family and I feel that at my young age, I have lost all hope for the future. Please God give me one chance to show you that I can be a good mother and give me the strength and stability I need for the bumpy road that lay ahead. <3","December 7, 2010 at 11:21 pm",1 Reply,"About misspatience

My name is Patience and I am 20 years old. I am a healthy active person and I love to stay in shape. I recently went to the doctor and I have found out that I may have Pelvic Imflamatory Disease (PID). I found out that this can lead to infertility and now I feel like my entire future is ruined. I have a boyfriend and we live together and we planned to get engaged within the next year, but I am afraid that if I become infertile, then our future will be ruined as well. I would really love to hear the views of other women that share my fears or concerns and anyone who would like to contact me with any information would be great! Thank you all so much and God bless!

yemolas,https://www.inspire.com/m/yemolas/,"Chlamydia, often misspelt Clamidia, is one of the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Global chlamydia statistics show that an estimated 92 million new chlamydia infections occur each year, affecting more women (50 million) than men (42 million).

Chlamydia is caused by the bacterium chlamydia trachomatis. This bacteria can infect the cervix in women and the urethra and rectum in both men and women. Occasionally chlamydia can also affect other parts of the body, including the throat and eyes.

Chlamydia often has no symptoms, especially among women. If left untreated, chlamydia can cause serious problems later in life.
Chlamydia symptoms and signs
Chlamydia symptoms usually appear between 1 and 3 weeks after exposure but may not emerge until much later. Chlamydia is known as the âsilentâ disease as in many people it produces no symptoms. It is estimated that 70-75% of women infected with chlamydia are asymptomatic (have no symptoms) and a significant proportion of men also have no symptoms. Those who do have symptoms of chlamydia may experience:

WomenAn increase in vaginal discharge caused by an inflamed cervix;
the need to urinate more frequently, or pain whilst passing urine;
pain during sexual intercourse or bleeding after sex;lower abdominal pains;
irregular menstrual bleeding.
MenA white/cloudy and watery discharge from the penis that may stain underwear;
a burning sensation and/or pain when passing urine;
pain and swelling in the testicles.
Men are more likely to notice chlamydia symptoms than women, though they too may be asymptomatic.
In both men and women a chlamydia infection in the rectum will rarely cause symptoms.

How is chlamydia passed on?
Chlamydia can be transmitted:

By having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex with someone who is infected;
from a mother to her baby during vaginal childbirth;
by transferring the infection on fingers from the genitals to the eyes, although it is rare for this to happen","November 8, 2010 at 5:29 am",0 Replies,"About yemolas

yemolas,https://www.inspire.com/m/yemolas/,"What Is It?
AIDS is one of the most serious, deadly diseases in human history.

More than 20 years ago, doctors in the United States identified the first cases of AIDS in San Francisco and New York. Now there are an estimated 42 million people living with HIV or AIDS worldwide, and more than 3 million die every year from AIDS-related illnesses.

AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV destroys a type of defense cell in the body called a CD4 helper lymphocyte (pronounced: lim-fuh-site). These lymphocytes are part of the body's immune system, the defense system that fights infectious diseases. But as HIV destroys these lymphocytes, people with the virus begin to get serious infections that they normally wouldn't â that is, they become immune deficient. The name for this condition is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

As the medical community learns more about how HIV works, they've been able to develop drugs to inhibit it (meaning they interfere with its growth). These drugs have been successful in slowing the progress of the disease, and people with the disease now live much longer. But there is still no cure for HIV and AIDS.


Hundreds of U.S. teens become infected with HIV each year. HIV can be transmitted from an infected person to another person through blood, semen (also known as ""cum,"" the fluid released from the penis when a male ejaculates), vaginal fluids, and breast milk","November 8, 2010 at 5:24 am",0 Replies,"About yemolas

ora,https://www.inspire.com/m/ora/,"Yesterday I went for the sixth time to treat my HPV warts. I have had four acid treatments and two cryotherapy treatments. Yesterday was the excruciating and I won't mind if it works. My doctor keeps telling me that he is ""disappointed"" with the outcome we are getting with my treatment. My warts just keep coming back. What started as one small painful bump on the outside of my vagina has spread to up and down both sides, the inside, my rectum and my clitoris. I am so horrified by what I see that I can hardly bear to look anymore. Yesterday he said if I don't get better this time, he will do a biopsy.

I am too ashamed to talk to him on the phone as though his hearing my voice will clue him in to my shame and humiliation. I have not told my brother who I have always been so close to. HPV is isolating me from my family and turning me into a pariah and I AM LETTING IT. I am buying the lie that I am damaged and broken and disgusting.

jford3018,https://www.inspire.com/m/jford3018/,"To give some backround information...
I was diagnosed with HPV (genital warts) about 2 years ago at the age of 20. My GYN said that I had one of the worst cases he had ever seen. I went through a year of weekly treatments, where the doctor would use liquid nitrogen to burn the lesions (very painful). Eventually my GYN decided to perform a laser surgery that was finally going to heal my ongoing nightmare of a problem. Well, after the surgery, I went in for a check up and all looked well. I had minor scarring, but all of the warts seemed to be gone.

Now, it has been about 6 months since my surgery and I have now developed more warts. I do not know what to do! This has costed me countless days off from work, co-pays, and the surgery expenses, not to mention the emotional effects. I have decided it would be best not to return to the doctor I was seeing, since he waited a year to do the laser surgery he could of done to begin with.

Besides all of my problems with HPV I have experienced weight gain and acne since being diagnosed. This makes me think of a hormone imbalance.

So here are my questions...
1. Can hormones effect the production of Genital Wart reoccurances over and over again?

2. Should I seek a Specialized GYN? What kind(s)?

3. Should I also have in depth hormonal testing done?

Any helpful information or advice will be appreciated.","October 14, 2008 at 4:39 pm",2 Replies,"About jford3018

ora,https://www.inspire.com/m/ora/,"I have persistent hpv and have been struggling with it for 6 months. Let's be frank. I have genital warts that simply will not respond to treatment. In the past six months, I have gotten engaged, been diagnosed with an STD, had four acid treatments, two cryotherapy treatments and months of using a chemotherapy cream, and lost the ability to have sex. As I sit here tonight, i realize I had no choice about any of that (other than the engagement that I threw in to remind myself that there has been sweet through all this salt). I have lived in shame though and humiliation and I CHOSE that. I thought this would go very easily and I would recover and never need to reveal this to anyone other than my fiance and best friend. I was wrong and I underestimated the power of this virus, not just the horrors it has cursed my body with, but the emotional power it holds. I have spent hours and hours sitting in the fetal position on my bathroom floor literally wracked with sobs. I felt such shame I stopped being honest with my father and brother. My mother is no longer alive and this I could have told her. How do you tell the people you need most when they are men? It took me six months to figure this out. I told them the truth without using words like warts or acid or vagina. I got the point across and in the end this was the point. I am suffering and am afraid and I need support and love.

today at the gym I saw a friend that I knew back in middle school. I gave him a hug and we chit chatted about what we had been up to this past decade. He asked if I wanted to go play pool with him so we headed over to the billards room. when we got there I saw no sticks and I turned to ask him where the sticks were. he said that we had to go up front and get them, so i turned to go get some sticks. He grabbed me and started to force himself on me. i pushed him off and told him that I am engaged and I dont like where this is going.. he said, so typical!! "" oh your fiance doesnt have to know"" at this point i realized that he had a complete disregard of my feelings on the matter. he tried to force himself on me again and i pushed him down and ran back to the weight room...

my blood boils when I am confronted with boys like this, it sickens me down to my core... I am in shock over it, what would provoke him into doing something like that?! my only explination is that he was desperate and thought he could manipulate me... what a creep!!

jenbry2186,https://www.inspire.com/m/jenbry2186/,"Around 2004 I found out i had genital herpes didn't know who i got it from (know how just not who). It devestated me because i had just started a new relationship we had only been together for 2 months roughly. However, i was amazed at how when i told him he didn't care he realized we would have to take extra precautions when having sex and that was ok. We are still together to this day and we are married now. I just wanted to post something to give newly found out people that have STDs that there is hope to find someone out there who truely loves you and won't care that you have a disease. We all make mistakes and aren't as careful as we should be. I felt terrible for a long time and was confused as to why he still loved me and allowed that feeling of regret and depression and anger get the best of me. I became distant and not as loving or a good wife as i could have been. It's only recently that I've discovered the through the grace and mercy of God it's ok to make mistakes. God still loves us no matter what all we have to do is trust in him and he will show us the way to forgiveness and peace in the heart soul and mind. Now i understand that if someone has a problem with me have herpes or is judgement for other things i've done and my previous lifestyle choices then i need to just give those problems to God and express to them God's love and understanding and allow them to know it doesn't bother me and that i will pray for them to have understanding. No one in this world is perfect some of us make bigger mistakes then others but it doesn't change the fact that we are God's creation he is a loving father there to discipline and love us whenever we need it. Life isn't easy but it wasn't intended to be. So yes i have herpes and yes i've made terrible choices in my life and yes in a way i'm paying for those choices, but you know what, that doesn't matter. God has forgiven me and i've forgiven those in my life that have brought me struggles and pain. I'll have to deal with this for the rest of my life because as of right now there is no cure. But i don't let it get me down anymore it doesn't do anything good for me when i let it bring me down and keep me feeling in the dumps. I just continue to live me life with the ones i love I mean i can live a normal life by having children and not worrying about them getting the disease as long as i do what the doctor's suggest to prevent the child from getting it. May God's peace and mercy be with you all and i hope you look into what i has worked for me just test him. Test him by giving God all your problems I mean sincerely give him all your problems and see how much better and at peace you feel.

sidhedraoi,https://www.inspire.com/m/sidhedraoi/,"I look back at what life was a few years ago and I am amazed by the progress that I have made.

I think about it now and it seriously upsets me when people (mainly kids) see this disorder as a ""good"" thing or an ""alternative"" to exercise and eating right to be ""thin"" and healthy...

I understand the mentality (and yes, not to be cocky but its true, I HAVE heard it all before), but every time I hear it I have this driving feeling to ""kill"" that demon. I once heard that every person has his/her own monster to kill, Anorexia was mine... and I fought tooth and nail to regain my health.

The fact that no one seems to listen to my story and take heed to its warning upsets me, I fear for these people. I fear for they are blind to the truth of it all...

You don't understand what Hell it brings until you are sitting next to a 20 year old who has suffered a stroke due to anorexia... Look into her eyes and tell me you aren't afraid, because Death does NOT discriminate! and if you continue you may be just like her one day... her eyes glassy, fixed in one spot... staring into nothingness...

That was what it took for me to snap back into reality... There's no sugar coating this... The only way to overcome it is to battle, to FIGHT! Don't give into the Demon, Strive! Live! Survive! Battle on to see tomorrow!

Be stronger than the disorder... You want happiness? Then you fight for it, nothing in life is free... There's no magic pill and there's no fairy god mother to save you.

You are the keeper of your own destiny.

Im 22 years old and have been in a relationship w my current g/f for the last 4 months. She just turned 19 and had known me for 3 weeks before we started going steady. The reason i'm/ we are on the sight is bec. we were referred here by her mother when we told her about the situation we've come into. Back on the 25th of nov. while my girlfriend had been on vacation i had come across something i wasn't famaliar with on my scrotum. I went and got checked out at my local clinic 1 week before she was scheduled to return and the doctor took a look at what i noticed and told me it was HPV(Genital Warts) Since then we havn't had sex. The 2 small warts have been removed and totally healed. We do not know where to go from here. We planned on no imtimate contact till her 3rd vaccination shot. But when i went to my last check up with my local doctor he said there was no need. He told us the obvious, to use a condom if we had sex. And to not have sex if there was ever an outbreak. And if recovering from an outbreak, wait until totally healed. Also The area i had the warts were on the lower scrotum so direct contact to the interior walls of the vagina/cervix wouldnt happen. Decreasing the likelyhood of her getting cervical cancer if god forbid she got the virus."
akis17,https://www.inspire.com/m/akis17/,"Hey guys I have cin 1 and mild dysplasia I had a coloscopy done and am going for my first pap since then on the 14th. I feel like I should be doing more then I am. Should I have had leep done after my first coloscopy? I have seen a lot of posts that say they found out they had hpv and then had leep done??
Also the person who gave it to (my boyfriend) me can we still have sex or will we be passing it back and forth to each other? This whole thing is so confusing and it seems like everyone has different answers
I was also wondering about oral sex has any one seen the new research on oral cancer and hpv? any thoughts on it? I am guilty of oral sex before i found out about the hpv but it was one time so should i be stressing about that as well? ugh!","January 1, 2010 at 11:27 pm",1 Reply,"About akis17

tryingtogetthrough,https://www.inspire.com/m/tryingtogetthrough/,hi my name is kayla and not to long ago i found out that i had genital warts and herpes the herpes was not a big factor because they are easily to control for me by just taking meds every day.. but the genital warts have been a total disaster bringing me down to my lowest and weakest point i have ever seen in me. my story is i was with a guy not to long ago and he was cheating on me with another girl that had the virus and i found out afterwards once i went to the doctor and then had blamed my self for my past sexual encounters.. but not long after the boyfriend broke up with me to be with her and left me alone with this virus... i have had such a hard time figuring out how to controll these i have been to doctor and using a cream that seems to do nothing and they hurt so bad does anyone know what else to do??? but then i have another question since i have have had this i have only cleared up once but then came back after the break up doc says it could be stress is why they came back... but how do you go on to tell someone new that walks into your life how do you and when do you tell them something that is so vulnerable and embarissing to yourself and be able to trust that person is not going to spread your secret i mean how do you move on to still have a sex life when you have this.... i mean i know use a condom but what if your allergic to condoms like me then what do you do i so need help... please some advice upfront advice no text book advice that i have to decifer,"May 1, 2009 at 1:17 pm",1 Reply,"About tryingtogetthrough

ChrissyMV1,https://www.inspire.com/m/ChrissyMV1/,"I am 25 years old and 6 weeks ago I had my annual pap and for the first time ever it came back abnormal and positive for HPV (not sure which strain). I went in for a colposcopy and had 2 biopsies one from my cervix and the other from the cervical wall/canal and both came back CIN 1.

I went to a dietician and decided to improve my diet and got on a vitamin regimen in hopes of naturally clearing my infection (although I know I'll never rid myself of it).

My question is, although I'm doing all I can to boost my immune system and fight this active infection into remission, is it possible that by continuing to have sex with my boyfriend (who infected me, long story but I know it was him) can that keep the infection active?","October 19, 2009 at 10:56 am",1 Reply,"About ChrissyMV1

I just keep thinking about how I am going to have to go through the embarrassing ordeal of telling my future sexual partners about this. It's enough to make me never want to have sex again. I am not one to sleep around, and for the most part have used protection but of course there were the times when I didn't...! For the past year or so, I have been dealing with the HPV virus with my doctor and she tells me this is part of the HPV virus.

I'm 26, work full-time and go to school full-time. I don't have kids but have a dog who is basically my kid. I have been dealing with low-grade HPV since 2005 and high-grade HPV since 2008. In February 2009 I found out I have genital warts and started treatment immediatley. Although it's frustrating and very uncomfortable, I am realizing that I am not alone in this. I'm looking to make new friends and hope to learn more about this spreading virus an help as many people as I can cope as they begin their frustrating journey to being as healthy as they can be!"

Three years ago, I had surgery for anal warts. I want to be able to share my experience with ohers. I did not have anyone to talk to about what my options were and what surgey would be like. Please shoot an e-mail if you need to chat."
i_will_survive,https://www.inspire.com/m/i_will_survive/,"This is the month in which I was suppose to do my 2nd yet 3rd pap smear test to see how far my condition is. I was diagnosed with high risk Hpv and those hpv strains that cause Genital warts in February 2009 and in April I've removed them (surgerical) and I was advised by my doctor to wait another 6 months to do another pap smear and see if my condition made any changed.

This month has been the worst so far 1 being my doctor is leaving and she is the only person who has helped me and my best friend with our condition. She is the only doctor on the island that works for government that actually does their work and takes time with their patients. It’s hard accepting that she's leaving. I don’t trust anyone else so there's only one thing left for me to do is to find another doctor. Finding another doctor is the easy part accepting their prices is the hardest. To do the procedures that I need to do to prevent my condition turning into cancer ranges from the thousands up. My warts have appeared again and it’s very uncomfortable having them. The price to get them removed is $930 +.

All of this HPV shit is getting to me I've been able for the pass few months to block all of it out and live my life as if it was never there its not until now that its getting to me like this. I'm not rich like everywhere else things are very very hard. I hardly make much money and there's so many other things that is going on right now that have to be paid where am I going to find money to get my procedures done? Its hard I'm to a point where I want to cry and give up. The only option I have is to go to another country and have them done which is still going to be a financial strain but way less than paying $2,400 for a colocoscopy.

I'm to a point where I'm losing hope...","August 19, 2009 at 2:51 pm",2 Replies,"About i_will_survive

I had a biopsy a week ago today and got the results yesterday that I dont have cancer but the cells have gotten worst. The doctor wants me to come in and discuss what is next. Some of my friends believe that the doctor is going to want to do the LEEP procedure! Im scared to have this done cause the biopsy hasnt been fun! So I really dont think the LEEP will be any better!! I passed out twice after the biopsy(im the worst speller also so if im not spelling anything right let me know please and thank you). Also the stuff they use to make it stop bleeding came out and then doctor said that is because I put my nuva ring back in like she said and must have knocked it out of place!! So now I have been bleeding ever since. Im really tired of bleeding!!! My main thing right now is to be strong and ready for whatever the doctor thinks is best!! Im so happy that my mom is being there for me and going to every appointment, and she is gonna be by my side through anything the doctor throws at us!!","July 28, 2009 at 11:30 pm",1 Reply,"About gen1028

Hi, I found out about alittle over a year ago that I have HPV. I was really upset when I found out but now have learned to deal with it!! I just had to have a biopsy, and the doctor called and said that I dont have cancer but the cells have got worst so she wants me to come in and discuss some other options!! Im not sure what she wants to do but kind of scared!! My main concern is-will I be able to have kids? So im on here to try and connect with other women that are going through the same things as me and understand what is going on!! I work at Lowes in the flooring department! It requires alot of lifting which as been hard on me after my biopsy cause I believe that it has caused me to continue to bleed. My job is really important!! So I dont want any of this to effect it! But what I have been reading is that with alot of different things the doctors can do to clear up the cells requires no lifting for at least six weeks which can make my job hard!! If you have any other questions feel free to ask!!"
poetic_faerie87,https://www.inspire.com/m/poetic_faerie87/,"So, I really haven't been on in awhile mainly becuz I just got unmotivated like I always do and the whole diet and everything fell to the waist side (like always). I'm so sick of being big!!!!!!

So, the other day I went swimming with my best friend, brother, and his best friend and my mom sat on shore and took dozens and dozens of pictures of us. When I looked at them later I was completely disgusted with how I looked!!! How wide I was and how my fat hung out of every part of my shirt it could!!! You just never realize how big you are until you see yourself in pictures!!! It was terrible and there was no way I was gonna embarrass myself by putting them all over the internet.

My mom has been depressed and laying in bed basically in a pity party and just saying how she's so sick and tired of being fat and wants to lose weight!

My brother's best friend (and friends of the family) are moving to Florida at the end of August :( & they want us to come visit them once they get settled. So, my mom is slowing saving up to go there in March & we're gonna make it a goal to lose weight by then so we feel better and are able to do more things. I've never been to Florida so I'm excited and to be a lot thinner by then would be AMAZING!!!

So, today we're starting weight watchers and start going back to the gym! I'm not too excited about seeing how much I weigh and I don't really have the patience to lose weight...that's why I guess I haven't been able to stick to anything. I kinda wish I could just snap my fingers and me be down to 160 pounds! Unfortunately it doesn't work that way and somewhere deep down inside me I needa find the patience to stick through it and just think how great I will feel in March when we do got to Florida. How I'll be able to wear shorts without worrying if my legs are too fat and being to wear a bathing suit and actually look good in it....or at least feel somewhat confident in it.

I'm really gonna do this, this time you guys and I need all the help and inspiration and motivation I can get. So, every little bit helps! I am only 22 years old and I'm a pretty girl...it's time to lose this weight so I can be the real me and stop hiding behind this fat!!!!!","July 23, 2009 at 3:21 pm",9 Replies,"About poetic_faerie87

We are the team behind this site. We feel very fortunate to be able to work on a project that can make a real difference in helping people to live their lives happily.

Inspire was created in 2005 by a group of friends. We were each dealing with important medical issues in our families, and we found that while the Internet was a useful source for authoritative medical information, it was not a safe, welcoming place for us to find support.

We created Inspire to change all that. We envisioned a place where we as patients, caregivers, family and friends could support one another, and where we could do so in a safe, secure, privacy-protected environment.

We are dedicated to building the best online health communities possible. Like our community members, all of us have faced health challenges of our own - and we know from personal experience how valuable the support and encouragement of others can be.

Our tagline, 'Together We're Better', is at the heart of what we do."

I used to weigh 230 lb. Now my current weigh is 140 lb.
It was not too difficult to lose the weight. The most important thing was the size of the portions you eat and swim for at least 30 min everyday. If you want to know more about this send me an email. I will be happy to reply. A healthy mind and body are very important for me and Natural Selection.
